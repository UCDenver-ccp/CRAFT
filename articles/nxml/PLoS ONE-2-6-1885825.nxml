At weeks 4 and 12, the size and cellular composition of PPs were analysed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. PPs of KO mice were larger with an increased proportion of M cells and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. KO mice were also characterised by higher concentrations of TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, IL12 and IL4 measured by ELISA. In contrast, little differences were found in the PP-free ileum and the spleen of KO mice.

By consequence, CD is usually considered as an immune deficiency toward bacteria present in the gut lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the exact mechanism by which <italic>NOD2</italic> mutations are able to induce CD lesions is still subject to debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Maeda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Holler</italic> et al. reported that the three major mutations associated with CD (R702W, G908R and 1007fs) are also associated with severe acute GVHD and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) related mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Holler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

CD lesions are characterised by a T helper (Th) 1 immune response and several authors have shown that they are related with gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), known as lymphoid follicles (LFs). LFs are mainly encountered in the colon where they are isolated and in small bowel where they are grouped forming Peyer's patches (PP) which are known to be pivotal sites for the host immune response and for the entry of enteropathogen bacteria. CD lesions are most often localized in colon and distal ileum, where the LFs are the most abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-VanKruiningen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Fujimura</italic> et al. found that aphto&#x000ef;d ulcerations (which are often considered as the earliest CD lesions) are centred by LFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Fujimura1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to this spatial relationship, a temporal link between CD and PP development has also been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-VanKruiningen2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. PPs develop from birth to 10&#x02013;15 years of life and then undergo involution. The age-dependent incidence curve of CD is roughly parallel to the number of PP with a delay of about 10 years. Finally, ileal lesions are uncommon in young children and seniors where PP are rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Meinzer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Polito1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The role of GALT in GVHD has been suspected on both experimental models and clinical observations. Animal studies showed that death after BMT was prevented by gut decontamination and that prevention of mucosal damage also prevents lethal GVHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Hill1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In clinical practice, gut decontamination reduces the frequency and severity of GVHD. Finally, <italic>Murai</italic> et al. recently showed that PP deficient mice are resistant to GVHD, arguing for a crucial role of PPs in GVHD, at least in models that do not use conditioning of the host prior to adoptive transfer of the allogeneic donor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Murai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Welniak1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Considering all these elements, we hypothesized that <italic>Nod2</italic> may play a role in the structure and function of the GALT. Consequently, we used a new mouse model deficient for <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> i) to evaluate the involvement of Nod2 on the number and PPs size; ii) to assess whether <italic>Nod2</italic> modified cellular composition and cytokine expression of PPs; and iii) to determine whether <italic>Nod2</italic> may alter paracellular permeability and bacterial translocation of PPs in adult mice. Finally, we also examined if <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency affects the colonic response to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS), a classic experimental model of colitis in mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Body weight, intestinal length and intestinal weight were similar in KO and WT mice (supplementary information (SI) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s001">Table S1</xref>). Macroscopically, no inflammation was visible in KO mice according to Wallace and Ameho criteria (data not shown). KO mice exhibited an increased number of PP in comparison with WT mice at weeks 4, 12 and 52 after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>A</italic></xref>). At weeks 12 and 52, the number of isolated LFs per small intestine was also higher in KO mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, the number of PPs at birth was similar between KO and WT mice (6.2&#x000b1;0.5 <italic>vs.</italic> 6.0&#x000b1;0.4; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>Macroscopically, the size of PP formations appeared to be larger in adult KO mice (data not shown). To quantify this difference, the three biggest PPs of each mouse were pooled and their cells were counted. At weeks 4, 12 and 52, KO mice exhibited a higher cell number per PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">fig 1 <italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, cell counts were comparable in spleens of KO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Microscopic analyses of PP formations from KO mice revealed no gross abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>E</italic></xref>). Finally, as NOD2 modulates the NF-&#x003ba;appaB pathway and putatively the apoptosis, we investigated the number of apoptotic cells inside PPs. Immunohistochemistry experiments did not show differences between KO and WT mice for the number of caspase 3 positive cells (1.01&#x000b1;0.11 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.32&#x000b1;0.10; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g001">Fig 1 <italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p>In order to better characterise the phenotype of the cells present in PPs, we performed flow cytometry experiments using the B220, CD3 and CD11c antibodies. At week 12, no differences were seen regarding the relative proportions of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B-cells, CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells between KO and WT mice either for PPs or spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g002">Fig 2 <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Because some cells present in a limited number may be functionally important, we also investigated the relative proportion of Ly-6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) present in the PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g002">Fig 2 <italic>C</italic></xref>) and the number of M cells located inside the follicle associated epithelium (FAE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g002">Fig 2 <italic>D</italic></xref>). No difference of PMN relative proportion was observed in PPs of KO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g002">Fig 2 <italic>C</italic></xref>). At the opposite, M cell number was increased in the FAE of KO mice in comparison with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g002">Fig 2 <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>As T-cells are known to play a pivotal role in CD, we further analyzed the CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. At week 12, KO mice exhibited an increase of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell relative proportion within their PPs, whereas the proportion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g003">Fig 3 <italic>A</italic></xref>). As a mirror image, PPs from KO mice exhibited significantly fewer CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g003">Fig 3 <italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, no comparable differences were seen in the spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g003">Fig 3 <italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar data were obtained at week 4 (SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s003">Fig S1 <italic>A&#x02013;B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigated the phenotype of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells present in the PPs and spleens by examining the relative proportions of naive CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45Rb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, regulatory CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45Rb<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and memory CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45Rb<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. KO and WT mice had a similar relative proportion of naive, regulatory and memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells in PPs (SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s004">Fig S2 <italic>A</italic></xref>) and spleen (SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s004">Fig S2 <italic>B</italic></xref>). Flow cytometry analyses also failed to reveal a difference between KO and WT mice when investigating the annexin V positive CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells extracted from PPs (SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s004">Fig S2 <italic>C</italic></xref>) suggesting that the excess of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells observed in KO mice does not result from a defect of apoptosis.</p><p>Considering the differences of PP cell number and cellular composition, we further evaluated whether PPs from KO and WT mice might exhibit differences regarding their cytokine profile. Thus, the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; , IL-12, and IL-4 in PPs, PP-free ileum and spleen were determined by ELISA, at weeks 4 and 12. Levels of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-12, and IL-4 were significantly increased in PPs of KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g004">Fig 4</xref>). In contrast, less marked differences were seen between KO and WT mice in PP-free ileum where TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; were the only cytokines differentially expressed at week 4 but not in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g004">Fig 4</xref>). Finally, no differences were observed in spleens from KO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Cell composition and cytokine production may affect the function of PPs. We thus used Ussing chambers for determining the paracellular permeability through PP and PP-free ileum. PPs and PP-free ileum of KO mice exhibited a significant increase in paracellular permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">Fig 5 <italic>A</italic></xref>) while the electrical resistances were comparable (data not shown). In parallel to this change, mRNA expression levels of TJ proteins were affected in PP of KO mice. Indeed, expression of mRNAs encoding ZO-2 and ZO-1 were decreased by 45&#x00025; and 36&#x00025; (P&#x0003c;0.01 and P&#x0003c;0.06 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">Fig 5 <italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, Occludin expression was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">Fig 5 <italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Because Nod2 is involved in innate immunity we hypothesised that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency may affect the gut microflora. We thus counted the numbers of bacteria classified as <italic>Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus or Lactobacillus</italic> in the ileum of KO and WT mice. However, we did not observed differences between groups (SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000523.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Ussing chamber experiments were also performed to investigate the bacterial passage through PP. The passage of a chemically killed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (K-12) was higher in PP of KO mice (P&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">Fig 5 <italic>C</italic></xref>). This increased translocation was also observed using living non pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain J53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">Fig 5 <italic>D</italic></xref>). In contrast, translocation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> across free-PP ileum mucosa was very low and not significantly increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000523-g005">fig 5 <italic>C</italic></xref>).

However, because an association between GALT dysfonctions and GVHD, as well as spatial and temporal links between CD lesions and PP have been suggested by several authors, we used a new model of <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficient mouse, to explore the impact of <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> in PP development and function. We observed that adult KO mice exhibit an excess of PP and isolated LFs in the gut. PP from KO mice are characterized by an excess of M cells and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and a higher expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. These differences are associated with increased paracellular permeability and bacterial and yeast passage through PPs. Finally, we observed that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficient mice are more susceptible to TNBS induced colitis. As a whole, the here reported phenotype of the <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> KO mouse is reminiscent to the observations made in the Human diseases associated with <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> mutations: CD and GVHD.</p><p>Our data demonstrate first that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficient mice have an elevated number of PPs and isolated LFs after birth. As intestinal weight and length are similar between KO and WT mice, this finding does not seem to be secondary to an intestinal overgrowth. In addition, PPs from deficient mice are larger, as indicated by the macroscopic examination of the intestines and by the count of PP cells. As a result, <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> modulates the development of the GALT and <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency is characterised by an overgrowth of the lympho&#x000ef;d tissue present in the gut. This over-development of the lympho&#x000ef;d tissue seems to be specific to the GI tract as non significant change were observed in a systemic immune organe like spleen. The lack of difference in PP number between WT and KO mice at birth indicates that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> plays its role during post natal development of the GALT. While lymphotoxin and IL-7 signalling are essential for the organogenesis of PP during the embryonic stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-DeTogni1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Adachi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, it is widely believed that gut commensal bacteria are critical for the postnatal development of gut mucosal immune system, as demonstrated by studies on germ-free animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Neutra1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Such animals have an underdeveloped GALT and are resistant to experimental colitis and to severe GVHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Murai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thereby, pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs and NOD molecules, can be seen as good candidates by which the resident flora stimulates the development of GALT. However, TLRs play only a limited role in PP development at early postnatal stage in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Iiyama1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. At the opposite, our data suggest that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> plays a pivotal role in the postnatal development of GALT.</p><p>Because gut flora is important in PP development, it can be questioned if <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency affects gut flora composition of the host. In order to answer this question, we counted the bacteria most represented in the ileum and able to cultivate in standard conditions. We failed to demonstrate differences between KO and WT mice suggesting that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency does not induce gross abnormalities of the gut microflora. However, more discrete alterations cannot be discarded and additional experiments using germ-free animals and/or molecular methods for bacterial detection are required to further explore the relationship between <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> and the normal gut flora.</p><p>PPs have B-cell follicles and germinal centres surrounded by areas that contain predominantly T cells. The analysis of the PP from <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficient mice failed to reveal gross abnormalities in terms of microachitecture, apoptosis or cell composition (at least for the three main cell lineages present in PP, namely B-cells, T-cells and dendritic cells). This observation is in accordance with the previous descriptions of other <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> KO models of mice which failed to reveal gross intestinal abnormalities under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Pauleau1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the phenotype observed in the deficient mouse is reminiscent with the Human CD condition where large lymphoid aggregates with normal microarchitecture and cell composition have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Nascimbeni1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>LFs are covered by a specialised epithelium including M cells. These cells are able to transfer bacterial and food antigens from the gut lumen to antigen presenting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Neutra1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. They have thus a pivotal role in the function of PP. M cells were found more numerous in KO mice. In addition, PP of KO mice exhibited a higher proportion of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and a decreased percentage of CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T-cells. As Nod2 may modulate the apoptosis, we have hypothesized that this increase of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell number may result from an apoptosis defect in the lymphoid cells of KO mice. However, flow cytometry analyses revealed that the relative proportion of apoptotic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells from PP was similar between KO and WT mice. As a result, our experiments do not support the opinion that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficiency is characterised by a general apoptosis defect in the lymphoid tissue of KO mice. Finally, the altered immune cell composition is concomitant with an increase of pro-inflammatory Th1 but also anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine expression. Altogether, these results indicate that under basal condition, PPs of KO mice are characterised by an exaggerated immune response.</p><p>Cell composition and cytokine production may affect the function of PP. We thus used Ussing chambers for determining the paracellular permeability through PP and PP-free ileum. KO mice exhibited a significant increase of paracellular permeability. This result is in accordance with the altered intestinal permeability reported in CD patients and their healthy relatives, especially in case of <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Teahon1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Buhner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are known to modulate intestinal paracellular permeability. IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-4, act on membrane receptors of epithelial cells to increase tight junction permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Ferrier1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Perdue1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, on T84 cells IFN&#x003b3; decreased levels of ZO-1 and altered apical actin organisation, which leads to disorganisation of TJ and increased permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Youakim1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, PP from KO mice exhibited a decrease of ZO-1 and ZO-2 mRNA expression in comparison with WT mice. Consequently, the excessive concentration of IFN&#x003b3; observed in KO mice may down regulate the transcription of ZO-1 and ZO-2 mRNA expression and contribute to the increase paracellular permeability in KO mice. It is to note that this phenotype is reminiscent to the <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> associated Human disorders. Indeed, in CD patients, increased permeability has been reported to be mediated by TNF&#x003b1; and to precede the clinical relapse while GVHD has been treated by anti-TNF antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Zeissig1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Busca1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because of the changes in gut permeability, we finally studied the role of <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> in bacterial translocation. Bacterial passage of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and yeast ingress of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were higher through PP of KO mice. It is widely accepted that CD is related with an excessive bacterial translocation through the intestinal epithelium even if this hypothesis is not perfectly documented. The present data further support this opinion. In addition, this excess of yeast and bacteria translocation through PP of KO mice is in agreement with recent reports showing that mutated CD patients and their unaffected relatives develop more frequently antibodies to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>&#x02013;related protein, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> outer membrane porin C and CBir1 flagellin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Devlin1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The excessive bacteria and yeast passage reported here may participate in the enhancement of adaptive immune responses to microbial antigens.</p><p>The increased number of M cells can contribute to the high translocation rate observed in KO mice. However, because M cell differentiation is inducible by microbial challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Borghesi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, it may also be a consequence of bacterial translocations and additional experiments are required to further dissect this complex relationship. It is also possible to consider that <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> dysfunction facilitates bacterial entry through defective antibacterial peptide expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, impaired intracellular bactericidal capacity or reduced epithelial immune defence. Finally, bacterial translocation may also be secondary to primitive local cytokine changes. IFN&#x003b3; is known to increase the epithelial adherence of selected species of enteric bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Hess1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Ferrier</italic> et al. have shown that a chronic stress in mice drives an organ-specific cytokine expression pattern which in turn, alters the colonic mucosal barrier functions and favours bacterial translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Ferrier1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect is dependent on the presence of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and requires IFN&#x003b3; production. It is thus possible that bacterial translocation is a result of the immune changes rather than its cause and additional experiments are now required to answer this question.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> invalidation exacerbates the severity of TNBS induced colitis, as evidenced by the increase in all parameters characterising colonic inflammation (damages scores and mucosal levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12). This enhanced colitis-induced by TNBS might be explained by different mechanisms. Firstly, since microflora is required for TNBS-induced colonic mucosal damages and since <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> signaling has been shown to inhibit the TLR2-driven activation of Th1 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, one can hypothesize that the Th1 inflammatory response mediated by TLR-2 is increased in <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> deficient mice. Secondly, since GALT is reported to modulate the severity of TNBS-induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Dohi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000523-Dohi2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> it can be hypothesised that the TNBS induced colitis is exacerbated in <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> KO mice because of GALT overdevelopment. Finally, an alternative explanation could be that the observed defect in terms of intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation makes the intestine more susceptible to TNBS.</p><p>Altogether, the present data demonstrate that <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> is required to maintain the homeostatis of the PPs. Because <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> is a well demonstrated etiological factor for CD/GVHD, this conclusion is of particular importance for the understanding of disease mechanisms. Indeed, it further supports the opinion that the defect involved in the development of the gut lesions is related with PP and LF function. The GALT dysfunction observed in KO mice is associated with an excessive gut immune response and an increased bacterial translocation. These findings are consistent with our knowledge on the Human diseases associated with <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> mutations namely GVHD and CD and for which similar observations have been reported. As a result, the phenotype of the <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> KO mice can be seen as an attenuated model of CD/GVHD. It is to note that the absence of a full phenotype is not unexpected considering the multifactorial nature of the Human diseases where exposure to several additional unknown genetic and environmental risk factors is required for disease expression. At the opposite, our work indicates that the <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> KO mouse is a relevant model for investigating these other risk factors associated with CD and GVHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> was disrupted in mice by replacing the first coding exon carrying the majority of the sequence encoding the CARD domains including the start codon with a EGFP cassette.

In the second step, the PGKHygromycin selection cassette was removed by Cre recombinase. The double-headed arrows indicate the DNA fragments resulting from digestions with different enzymes expected to hybridize with probes A, B or Hyg. Also depicted are combinations of PCR primers P1-4 that detect the different <italic>Card15/Nod2</italic> alleles. (B) Southern blot analysis of restricted DNA resulting from digestion with XbaI.Hybridation with Probe A and B show complete integration of the targetting fragment after homologous recombination. Probe Hyg show the differents integrations of targetting fragments after homologous recombination. (C) Genotyping of Nod2-deficient mice by PCR. Genomic DNA from mice was amplified by PCR to detect the disrupted sequence (PCR product of 459 bp). (D) Expression of Nod2 mRNA in spleen. RT-PCR was performed on purified mRNA from the spleen of WT and KO mice. As expected, no signal was observed in KO mice.
