Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by early obesity and sensory impairment, symptoms shared with other genetic diseases affecting proteins of the primary cilium. ALMS1 localizes to centrosomes and ciliary basal bodies, but truncation mutations in <italic>Alms1</italic>/<italic>ALMS1</italic> do not preclude formation of cilia. Here, we show that in vitro knockdown of <italic>Alms1</italic> in mice causes stunted cilia on kidney epithelial cells and prevents these cells from increasing calcium influx in response to mechanical stimuli. The stunted-cilium phenotype can be rescued with a 5&#x02032; fragment of the <italic>Alms1</italic> cDNA, which resembles disease-associated alleles. In a mouse model of Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome, Alms1 protein can be stably expressed from the mutant allele and is required for cilia formation in primary cells. Aged mice developed specific loss of cilia from the kidney proximal tubules, which is associated with foci of apoptosis or proliferation. As renal failure is a common cause of mortality in Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome patients, we conclude that this disease should be considered as a further example of the class of renal ciliopathies: wild-type or mutant alleles of the Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome gene can support normal kidney ciliogenesis in vitro and in vivo, but mutant alleles are associated with age-dependent loss of kidney primary cilia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>ALMS1</italic> gene. The disease is characterized by blindness, deafness, and metabolic disorders. These symptoms are reminiscent of diseases affecting the primary cilium, a cellular appendage with a role in sensing changes to the extracellular environment. In addition, kidney failure is a frequent cause of death in Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome patients, and recent studies have suggested a causal relationship between defects in primary cilia and cystic kidney diseases. In this paper, we show that ALMS1 protein is required to form cilia in kidney cells. Mutant alleles of the gene that are similar to those seen in the human disease are able to support cilia formation in cell culture and in animals. However, a defect in the function of the disease alleles is uncovered in older mice: cilia are lost from the kidney cells, and this is associated with an increase in cellular proliferation and cell death. The data are consistent with a requirement for ALMS1 in ciliogenesis and suggest inclusion of Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome among the growing class of cilia-related pathologies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Li G, Vega R, Nelms K, Gekakis N, Goodnow C, et al.

First, mutations in genes that are implicated in the function of primary cilia are associated with kidney diseases. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by progressive development of fluid-filled cysts, ultimately leading to end-stage renal failure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Second, the spectrum of phenotypes seen in Alstr&#x000f6;m patients is similar to Bardet-Biedl patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that mutations in <italic>ALMS1</italic> might cause disease through a similar mechanism to <italic>BBS</italic> mutations. It is now well documented that several of the 11 genes mutated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) have roles in the function of primary cilia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Fourth, in vivo phenotypes of <italic>Alms1</italic> mutant mice include a lack of sperm flagella, a modified ciliary structure, as well as defective rhodopsin transport through the connecting cilia of photoreceptor cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>These data point to a role of ALMS1 in the function of primary cilia, but no defects in cilia formation were observed in human dermal fibroblasts from an Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome patient &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; or in the kidney collecting duct epithelial cells of a gene-trap <italic>Alms1</italic> mutant mouse strain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. A possible resolution of this discrepancy comes from the genetic analysis of mutations in <italic>ALMS1</italic> that have been found in patients. In all cases, there was at least one allele of <italic>ALMS1</italic> that could encode an N-terminal fragment of the ALMS1 protein before the presence of a premature stop codon. Moreover, the alleles in two reported mice models of Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome would also be predicted to encode the N-terminus of Alms1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it is possible that ALMS1 is required for cilia formation, and that the disease-associated alleles are able to provide at least part of this activity through expression of the N-terminus of the protein. In this study, we test whether ALMS1 has a role in cilia formation or function and provide evidence that renal failure in Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome patients might be associated with ciliary dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Depletion of Alms1 mRNA and Protein by Short Interfering RNA Causes Defective Ciliogenesis in Kidney Cells</title><p>To determine whether Alms1 was necessary for cilium formation and/or function, we used an in vitro model of kidney cell ciliogenesis and signaling.

The cilia can be visualized as long protrusions from the cell surface using an antibody raised against acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). We tested several short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules designed against the mouse <italic>Alms1</italic> sequence for their effects on formation of cilia in this model. Cilia were formed normally in the presence of a negative control siRNA. However, transfection with two siRNA sequences against <italic>Alms1,</italic> Alms1a and Alms1b, led to a markedly different phenotype. The acetylated tubulin staining on each cell manifested as a single ball of fluorescence, and very few cells showed the elongated staining typical of ciliary axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Both of these siRNA species also caused a decrease in the <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, two additional siRNAs (Alms1c and Alms1d) did not affect the pattern of acetylated tubulin staining in the ciliogenesis assay, nor did they affect the <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g001">1</xref>B).

As an initial characterization of the role of Alms1 in the mIMCD3 in vitro model, we asked whether Alms1 protein was required for the transcriptional response associated with ciliogenesis. A time course of mIMCD3 ciliogenesis showed a steady rise in the level of <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA after confluency. This was paralleled by an increase in cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g002">2</xref>B). We chose two other cilia-related genes that have increased mRNA levels during ciliogenesis, <italic>Bbs4</italic> and <italic>Ttc10. Bbs4</italic> (BBS gene 4) encodes a protein localized to the basal body and centrosome that is required for targeting cargo to the pericentriolar region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;; <italic>Ttc10</italic> (IFT88/polaris) is required for transport of cargo from basal body to the distal cilium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Bbs4</italic> and <italic>Ttc10</italic> mRNA were upregulated even when ciliogenesis was disrupted with Alms1a siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, microarray analysis showed that knockdown of <italic>Alms1</italic> by siRNA had no effect on the general transcription program associated with confluency and ciliogenesis in the mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030008-st001">Table S1</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p><p>We then used this model to ask whether the stunted cilia formed in limiting amounts of Alms1 were functionally competent.

In these alleles, the 5&#x02032; terminus of the gene encodes an intact open reading frame that might give rise to a partially functional protein. Therefore, we tested whether a truncated 5&#x02032; cDNA was able to rescue cilia formation after <italic>Alms1</italic> knockdown. We transfected a mouse <italic>Alms1</italic> cDNA encoding the N-terminal 1,282 amino acids, equivalent to exons 1&#x02013;8, into mIMCD3 cells in the presence of the Alms1a siRNA. The Alms1a siRNA sequence matches the <italic>Alms1</italic> gene 3&#x02032; of the cDNA fragment and so was predicted to affect only the levels of the endogenous transcript and not expression of the cDNA encoding the N-terminus of Alms1. As expected, transfection with Alms1a siRNA caused focal acetylated tubulin staining. However, cotransfection of the <italic>Alms1</italic> cDNA with Alms1a siRNA was fully capable of rescuing the cilia phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). To monitor the effects of cDNA transfection on knockdown of the endogenous mRNA level, we used a Taqman assay recognizing the boundary of exons 12 and 13 of the <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA. This assay will detect the endogenous full-length transcript but not the transfected cDNA and shows that cotransfection of the cDNA did not affect knockdown of the endogenous transcript. Conversely, using a Taqman assay recognizing the 5&#x02032; of <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA that detects both the endogenous and cDNA-encoded transcript, we showed that cotransfection with the siRNA Alms1a did not affect over-expression of the <italic>Alms1</italic> 5&#x02032; cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>To determine whether a premature truncation allele of the <italic>Alms1</italic> gene can support normal ciliogenesis at endogenous expression levels, we used primary cells from a mouse strain with an ethyl nitroso urea&#x02013;induced, premature truncation mutation in exon 10 of the <italic>Alms1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030008-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The <italic>Alms1</italic> gene in this mutant strain is predicted to encode the N-terminal 2,131 amino acids of the mouse Alms1 protein, and we therefore named the allele <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup>.</italic> Similar expression of <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA was observed across eight tissues in wild-type and homozygous <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In particular, levels of <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA in the kidney of mutant <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mice are at least as high as in the wild-type control mice. In addition, we detected mutant Alms1 protein localized at the base of cilia of <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> primary kidney cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Thus, despite the presence of a premature stop codon allele in the <italic>Alms1</italic> gene of these mice, both mRNA and protein were readily detectable. By isolating primary fibroblasts and kidney cells from <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mice and wild-type controls, we found that cells from the <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> strain showed normal primary cilia when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), which is consistent with previous reports &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Homozygous mutant mice increased in weight faster than wild-type controls between 7 and 10 wk of age, and body composition analysis showed that this increase was almost entirely explained by an increase in fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

Consistent with a previous report &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, primary cilia appeared normal in collecting ducts of the renal medulla. However, we noticed that some cortex tubules appeared to be almost completely denuded of cilia in aged <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g005">5</xref>B). To further characterize these tubules, we stained the kidney sections with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lotus tetragonolobus</named-content> agglutinin (LTA) as a proximal tubular marker, and with aquaporin-2 antibody as a marker of collecting ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). In both the wild-type and <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mutant animals, the aquaporin-2-labeled collecting duct cells have clear primary cilia as expected. LTA-labeled proximal tubule cells in the wild-type animals were also ciliated. In contrast, most of the LTA-labeled proximal tubules of <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mutants were not ciliated.</p><p>Human PKD is thought to originate from renal tubule dilatation, secondary to abnormalities in cellular proliferation and apoptosis. We examined kidney sections from wild-type and mutant mice with a marker for proliferation, Ki67, and by TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Sparse proliferation was seen in wild-type kidney sections. Higher levels of proliferation were detected in the cortex of kidneys from <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mice, and this was focused in patches, perhaps representing convolutions of the same tubule coming into the plane of sectioning. In most of the cross sections of dilated tubules, several (20&#x00025;&#x02013;50&#x00025;) of the epithelial cells were Ki67-positive, and these cells lacked cilia. We also noted a dramatic increase in kidney epithelial cell apoptosis in the mutant mice. As with Ki67, it was striking that TUNEL-positive cells had a nonuniform distribution and seemed to be clustered within particular tubules, whereas other tubules appeared identical to wild-type controls. These changes appeared to compromise kidney function, as urinanalysis revealed a mild proteinurea in adult <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030008-g005">Figure 5</xref>E).

However, amino acid sequence analysis identifies only a leucine zipper near the N-terminus, allowing limited inferences to be made about the function of this protein. Localization of ALMS1 to the centrosome and ciliary basal body has been determined using a green fluorescent protein fusion to its C-terminus, and with an N-terminal antibody, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. These data are consistent with a role for ALMS1 in the function of cilia, which is supported by the overlapping clinical phenotypes between Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome and other ciliopathies, especially BBS. Additionally, mouse models of BBS and Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome lack sperm flagella and a modified cilium; and show aberrant transport of rhodopsin, pointing to defective function of the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells.</p><p>In this paper, we investigated whether Alms1 protein is required for the formation of cilia and, if so, whether cilia can be formed in human or mouse cells with a mutated <italic>ALMS1/Alms1</italic> gene. We used an in vitro model of kidney ciliogenesis to demonstrate that knockdown of <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA caused a striking alteration in the morphology of cilia: knockdown of <italic>Alms1</italic> caused stunted or focal staining of acetylated tubulin. The specificity of the siRNA reagents was confirmed by two pieces of evidence. First, two siRNAs that were active in decreasing mRNA expression were also active in decreasing formation of elongated cilia. Conversely, two additional <italic>Alms1</italic> siRNAs, as well as a negative control siRNA, did not decrease <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA nor did they affect the ciliary phenotype. Second, the ciliary phenotype that was induced by <italic>Alms1</italic> siRNA knockdown could be rescued by cotransfection of a 5&#x02032; fragment of <italic>Alms1</italic> that was not targeted by the active siRNA. Together these results rule out the possibility that the cilia phenotype caused by siRNA knockdown was an off-target effect, and point to a role of Alms1 in the maintenance or biogenesis of cilia.</p><p>Interestingly, previous work had shown that cilia were formed in cells with mutant <italic>ALMS1/Alms1.</italic> To reconcile those findings with our siRNA knockdown data, we posited a functional role for the truncated Alms1 protein encoded by the mutant alleles. <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA in our mutant mouse strain was present at levels similar to those in wild-type mice, despite the presence of a premature stop codon. We also found that the mutant Alms1 protein was detectable and localized to ciliary basal bodies in cells from these mice, just as was observed for wild-type Alms1. Additionally, in unpublished data, immunohistochemistry with the antibody raised against the N-terminus of Alms1 showed prominent staining in the mutant pancreatic islets, confirming that protein could be stably expressed from the mutant allele. To test whether there was a function for the mutant protein, we showed that knockdown of the mutant <italic>Alms1</italic> mRNA inhibited ciliogenesis in primary cells from these mice. We also showed that the ciliary phenotype induced by knockdown of <italic>Alms1</italic> could be rescued using a cDNA encoding only the N-terminal 1,282 amino acids of Alms1, confirming that the N-terminus of Alms1 is sufficient to support cilia formation.</p><p>A spectrum of nonsense and frameshift mutations cause Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome, and all have different effects. However, no genotype/phenotype correlation has been observed among human patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, two mouse models of Alstr&#x000f6;m syndrome reported to date, as well as a third model reported in this manuscript, contained alleles that were predicted to encode the N-terminus of the protein, and the reported phenotypes are very consistent. Thus, we suggest that truncation of ALMS1/ Alms1, secondary to mutations in (predominantly) exons 8, 10, and 16, leads to similar phenotypes in human and mouse. In particular, we provide evidence for residual function of the disease-associated alleles. This residual function of mutant <italic>Alms1</italic> alleles might explain a lack of the more severe developmental phenotypes described in animal models with mutations of intraflagellar transport (IFT) or kinesin motor proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>There is growing support for the &#x0201c;antenna&#x0201d; role of primary cilium as a key participant in sensing environmental stimuli, transduction of intracellular signaling, and regulation of morphogenetic pathways.

It has been proposed that urine flow terminates the canonical Wnt pathway in favor of the noncanonical Wnt pathway. The noncanonical Wnt pathway might then maintain planar cell polarity and restrict cell division in a direction parallel to the long axis of the tubule. Moreover, BBS proteins have been shown to directly interact with proteins which regulate planar cell polarity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as in ciliary protein transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting a model in which defects in cilia disrupt planar cell polarity signaling and lead to disorientated cell division and cyst formation.</p><p>Existing mouse PKD animal models are characterized by the formation of early-onset cysts in the collecting tubules, reminiscent of human ARPKD. In contrast, the <italic>Alms1</italic> mutant mouse model presented here shows cilia loss in the proximal tubules. Further, adult mice progress to a breakdown in maintenance of kidney epithelial cellular quiescence, with a dramatic increase in apoptotic and proliferating cells restricted to those tubules that have lost cilia. This is accompanied by tubular dilatation and mild proteinurea in older mutant mice. All these phenotypes are similar to clinical features of ADPKD, making the <italic>Alms1<sup>L2131X/L2131X</sup></italic> mouse strain an interesting animal model to study the relation of cilia loss, altered signaling, and cellular proliferation in the progression of cystic kidney disease in the proximal tubules.</p><p>Initiation of ADPKD is suggested to be dependent on a second somatic mutation in the wild-type allele of PKD1 or PKD2. Evidence for this hypothesis is controversial as somatic mutagenesis rates in nontransformed cells are likely to be too low to explain the high prevalence of bilateral disease in heterozygous carriers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d; and a reduced expression of PKD1 is sufficient to initiate cystogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030008-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In this recessive model of ciliary dysfunction in the kidney, we also observe localized expression of the cellular phenotype (cilia loss, apoptosis, or proliferation). This suggests that in this model, and perhaps in human late-onset kidney diseases, non-genetic and/or epigenetic factors are necessary for expression of the phenotype. The disease-like allele of <italic>Alms1,</italic> although functionally able to support cilia formation in vitro, in young mice and in older mice in the kidney medulla, might reveal a compromised function in the cortex during aging. We also note that the expression of the cellular kidney phenotype in our model is not random but shows a variegated pattern on a tubule-by-tubule basis. Some tubule cross sections appear to have normal cilia, and little to no proliferation or apoptosis, whereas other tubule cross sections show extensive loss of cilia, sometimes with all or nearly all of the epithelial cells either proliferating or in apoptosis. The presumed somatic event, which, in combination with a genetic predisposition, causes some tubules to appear dysfunctional while neighboring tubules have a wild-type appearance, is not known. However, more detailed characterization of the progression of the phenotype might suggest treatments that maintain tubular integrity and delay disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and ciliogenesis assay.</title><p>mIMCD3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (www.atcc.org) and cultured in DMEM/F12 media (Invitrogen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>) supplement with 10&#x00025; FBS, 2.5 mM L-glutamine.
