The molecular mechanisms that create and maintain this thin layer of cartilage that covers the surface of bones in joint regions are poorly understood, in part because tools to manipulate gene expression specifically in this tissue have not been available. Here we use regulatory information from the mouse <italic>Gdf5</italic> gene (a bone morphogenetic protein &#x0005b;BMP&#x0005d; family member) to develop new mouse lines that can be used to either activate or inactivate genes specifically in developing joints. Expression of Cre recombinase from <italic>Gdf5</italic> bacterial artificial chromosome clones leads to specific activation or inactivation of floxed target genes in developing joints, including early joint interzones, adult articular cartilage, and the joint capsule. We have used this system to test the role of BMP receptor signaling in joint development. Mice with null mutations in <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> are known to die early in embryogenesis with multiple defects. However, combining a floxed <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> allele with the <italic>Gdf5</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> driver bypasses this embryonic lethality, and leads to birth and postnatal development of mice missing the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> gene in articular regions. Most joints in the body form normally in the absence of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> receptor function. However, articular cartilage within the joints gradually wears away in receptor-deficient mice after birth in a process resembling human osteoarthritis. <italic>Gdf5</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> mice provide a general system that can be used to test the role of genes in articular regions. BMP receptor signaling is required not only for early development and creation of multiple tissues, but also for ongoing maintenance of articular cartilage after birth. Genetic variation in the strength of BMP receptor signaling may be an important risk factor in human osteoarthritis, and treatments that mimic or augment BMP receptor signaling should be investigated as a possible therapeutic strategy for maintaining the health of joint linings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Through genetic manipulation, these authors have reduced signaling by bone morphogenetic factors in joint regions, and created a valuable model for the study of arthritis</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thin layers of articular cartilage line the bones of synovial joints and provide a smooth, wear-resistant structure that reduces friction and absorbs impact forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Brandt1">Brandt et al. 1998</xref>). Loss or damage to articular cartilage is a hallmark of arthritic diseases and is one of the most common reasons that both young and old adults seek medical care.

Programmed cell death occurs within the interzone, and a three-layered interzone forms that has two layers of higher cell density flanking a region of lower cell density. Non-joint precursors of the skeleton typically develop into cartilage, which hypertrophies and is replaced by bone. However, cells within the high-density layers of the interzone are excluded from this process and develop into the permanent layers of articular cartilage found in the mature joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mitrovic1">Mitrovic 1978</xref>).</p><p>Studies over the last 10 y have begun to elucidate some of the signaling pathways that contribute to the early stages of joint formation. <italic>Wnt14</italic> is expressed in stripes at the sites where joints will form, and it is capable of inducing expression of other joint markers when misexpressed at new locations in the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Hartmann1">Hartmann and Tabin 2001</xref>). Several members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of secreted signaling molecules are also expressed in stripes at sites where joints will form, including those encoded by the genes <italic>Gdf5, Gdf6, Gdf7, Bmp2,</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Storm1">Storm and Kingsley 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Wolfman1">Wolfman et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Francis-West1">Francis-West et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Settle1">Settle et al. 2003</xref>). Of these, <italic>Gdf5</italic> expression is most strikingly limited to regions where joints will develop and is one of the earliest known markers of joint formation.

Recent experiments have implicated two different BMP type I receptors in skeletal patterning, BMPR1A and BMPR1B. Both receptors can bind BMP2, BMP4, and GDF5, although GDF5 shows higher affinity for BMPR1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Koenig1">Koenig et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-ten1">ten Dijke et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Yamaji1">Yamaji et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Nishitoh1">Nishitoh et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Chalaux1">Chalaux et al. 1998</xref>). Both receptors are also expressed in dynamic patterns during normal development. In limbs, <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> expression becomes restricted to joint interzones, perichondrium, periarticular cartilage, hypertrophic chondrocytes, and interdigital limb mesenchyme. In comparison, <italic>Bmpr1b</italic> expression is seen primarily in condensing precartilaginous mesenchymal cells, regions flanking joint interzones, perichondrium, and periarticular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Dewulf1">Dewulf et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mishina2">Mishina et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Zou2">Zou et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Baur1">Baur et al. 2000</xref>).

Recent studies with floxed alleles suggest that <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> is also required for many later developmental events, but its roles in bone and joint formation have not yet been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mishina1">Mishina 2003</xref>).</p><p>A genetic system for activating or inactivating genes specifically in joint tissues would be particularly useful for further studies of joint formation and maintenance. Here we take advantage of the tissue-specific expression pattern of the <italic>Gdf5</italic> gene to engineer a <italic>Cre</italic>/<italic>loxP</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Nagy1">Nagy 2000</xref>), <italic>Gdf5-Cre,</italic> that can be used to remove or ectopically express genes in joints. Tests with reporter mice show that this system is capable of modifying genes in all of the structures of the mature synovial joint, including the ligaments of the joint capsule, the synovial membrane, and the articular cartilage. <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> recombination bypasses the early embryonic lethality of null mutations in <italic>Bmpr1a,</italic> and shows that this receptor is required for early joint formation at some locations and for initiation of programmed cell death in webbing between digits. Interestingly, <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> is also required for postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage throughout most of the skeleton. In <italic>Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1a<sup>floxP</sup></italic> mice, articular cartilage initially forms normally, but subsequently loses expression of several key cartilage markers after birth. It ultimately fibrillates and degenerates, resulting in severe osteoarthritis and loss of mobility. These experiments suggest that BMP signaling is required for normal maintenance of postnatal articular cartilage, and that modulation of the BMP signaling pathway may play an important role in joint disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genetic System for Testing the Function of Genes in Joint Development</title><p>To generate a general system capable of specifically testing genes for functions in skeletal joint development, we engineered transgenic mice to express Cre recombinase in developing joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Gdf5</italic> is a gene strongly expressed in stripes across developing skeletal elements during embryonic joint formation. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the <italic>Gdf5</italic> locus was modified by homologous recombination in bacteria to insert a cassette encoding Cre-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP) into the translation start site of <italic>Gdf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This modified BAC was then used to make lines of transgenic mice. The resulting <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice were tested for transgene expression and Cre recombinase activity by crossing them to R26R reporter mice that activate the expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> after Cre-mediated removal of transcriptional stop sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Soriano1">Soriano 1999</xref>). The resulting progeny were analyzed both for expression of the transgene by assaying HPLAP activity and for recombination of DNA by assaying LACZ activity. The progeny from all three lines showed strong LACZ expression primarily in joints, and in two of three lines HPLAP expression could also be seen in joint regions. Interestingly, HPLAP expression in the <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgenic GAC(A) line used for all subsequent breeding experiments was seen to precede LACZ expression during successive development of joints in the digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) (unpublished data). These experiments clearly demonstrate that the <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgene expresses Cre recombinase and causes DNA recombination in developing joint regions.</p><p>GAC(A) mice were crossed with <italic>lacZ ROSA26 Cre</italic> reporter strain (R26R) mice to analyze the pattern of Cre-mediated <italic>lacZ</italic> recombination throughout development. Joints in developing limbs begin forming in a proximal-distal pattern such that the shoulder joint forms prior to the elbow joint. In addition, three major stages of early joint development have been defined by histology as (1) interzone formation, (2) three-layer interzone formation, and (3) cavitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mitrovic1">Mitrovic 1978</xref>). Consistent with the proximal-distal pattern of joint development in the limbs, LACZ activity is seen at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) in the more proximal joints, including the shoulder and knee (unpublished data). By E14.5, LACZ expression is typically seen in all but the most distal joints of the limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">1</xref>C), but with some variability in both strength and extent of expression from embryo to embryo. The strongest-staining embryos often have additional staining in fingertips (not seen in the E14.5 embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, but clearly detectable in the E13.5 embryo shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Sections through developing joints show that LACZ is present in many cells at the interzone stage (unpublished data). However, expression of LACZ in nearly 100&#x00025; of joint cells is not achieved until the three-layer interzone stage (for example, in the knee joint at E14.5 or in any of the phalangeal joints at E16.5 (unpublished data). Within the developing skeleton, Cre-mediated expression of LACZ remains strikingly specific to joints throughout development. Furthermore, it is seen in all the structures of postnatal synovial joints including the articular cartilage, joint capsule, and synovial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">1</xref>E) (unpublished data). These patterns are consistent with the well-established expression of <italic>Gdf5</italic> in interzone regions during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Storm1">Storm and Kingsley 1996</xref>). Adult expression patterns of the <italic>Gdf5</italic> gene are not as well characterized, but <italic>Gdf5</italic> expression has previously been detected in adult articular cartilage using both RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Chang1">Chang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Erlacher1">Erlacher et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Bobacz1">Bobacz et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Other sites besides limb joints also have Cre-mediated <italic>lacZ</italic> expression. Starting at E13.5, LACZ activity is detected in an anterior and posterior domain of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). At E14.5, LACZ activity is detectable in the developing ear pinnae, ribs, sternum, tissues in the face, and some regions of the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) (unpublished data). At birth, LACZ is also expressed in tendons running along the vertebral column, regions of tendons in the wrist and ankle, and some tendon insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) (unpublished data). By 5 wk of age, LACZ is also expressed in the hair follicles, ear cartilage, some cells in the growth plate of the long bones, and portions of the brain and spinal cord (unpublished data). Surprisingly, 23 of 63, or 37&#x00025; of transgenic mice analyzed also show some degree of wider &#x0201c;ectopic&#x0201d; LACZ expression, which can extend throughout many different tissues in the animal. However, sustained expression of the transgene itself, as assayed by HPLAP activity, is still restricted primarily to joints in animals that show evidence of more generalized recombination based on LACZ expression (unpublished data). This suggests that in a fraction of animals, sporadic expression of Cre at some time early in development is sufficient to lead to both ectopic recombination and LACZ expression. While the fraction of animals with broader recombination patterns must be tracked and accounted for during experiments, these animals offer the potential benefit of revealing additional new functions of target genes that could be subsequently studied with additional site-specific Cre drivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1a<sup>floxP</sup></italic> Animals Survive to Adulthood with Ear, Webbing, and Joint Defects</title><p>We next used the <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> system to test the role of BMP signaling during normal joint development. <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice were bred to animals carrying a conditional floxed allele of the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mishina3">Mishina et al. 2002</xref>)<italic>,</italic> usually in the presence of the <italic>R26R</italic> reporter allele to facilitate simultaneous visualization of Cre-mediated recombination patterns (see typical cross in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">Figure 3</xref>). PCR amplification confirmed that a key exon of the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> gene was deleted in mice that also carried the <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgene (unpublished data). Previous studies have shown that the recombined <italic>Bmpr1a<sup>floxP</sup></italic> allele mimics a null allele of the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> locus when transmitted through the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Mishina3">Mishina et al. 2002</xref>).

First, the conditional knockout mice had shorter ears that often lay flatter against their heads than controls (controls 13.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm long, <italic>n</italic> = 38; mutants 11.8 &#x000b1; 0.2 mm, <italic>n</italic> = 11; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). BMP signaling is known to be required for growth of the external ear of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Kingsley1">Kingsley et al. 1992</xref>), and this phenotype likely reflects loss of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> function in the fraction of ear cells that express the <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgene. Most mutant mice also showed soft tissue syndactyly or retention of webbing between the first and second digits of their feet, a phenotype that was more frequent and more severe in the forelimbs (201 of 220, or 91&#x00025;, of forefeet and 109 of 220, or 50&#x00025;, of hindfeet). Finally, mutant animals showed obvious skeletal changes in whole-mount skeletal preparations. At some sites in the ankles, joints seemed to be missing entirely, with fusion of bones that would normally be separate. For example, the second distal tarsal was fused to the central tarsal bone in every conditional knockout animal examined (18 of 18), a phenotype not observed in controls (zero of 18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">3</xref>C). At other locations, joints had clearly formed but showed dramatic loss of staining with the cartilage matrix marker Alcian blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">3</xref>E) (unpublished data).

Therefore, TGF&#x003b2; and BMP signaling are playing distinct but necessary roles to maintain articular cartilage.</p><p>Although BMPs were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to induce ectopic bone formation, their presence in articular cartilage and strong effect on cartilage formation has stimulated interest in using them to repair or regenerate cartilage defects in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Chang1">Chang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Erlacher1">Erlacher et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Edwards1">Edwards and Francis-West 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Chubinskaya1">Chubinskaya and Kuettner 2003</xref>). The failure to maintain articular cartilage in the absence of normal BMPR1A function suggests that ligands or small molecule agonists that interact specifically with this receptor subtype may be particularly good candidates for designing new approaches to maintain or heal articular cartilage at postnatal stages.</p><p>Lack of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> function in articular cartilage results in severe fibrillation of the articular surface and loss of joint mobility. The development of severe arthritis symptoms in <italic>Bmpr1a</italic>-deficient mice raises the possibility that defects in BMP signaling also contribute to human joint disease. Osteoarthritis is known to have a significant genetic component, but it likely involves multiple genetic factors that have been difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Spector1">Spector et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Felson1">Felson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Hirsch1">Hirsch et al. 1998</xref>). Humans that are heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations in <italic>BMPR1A</italic> are known to be at risk for juvenile polyposis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Howe1">Howe et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Zhou1">Zhou et al. 2001</xref>), but the risk of osteoarthritis for these people has not been reported. However, the control mice used in this study were heterozygous for a null allele of <italic>Bmpr1a,</italic> and they showed little sign of osteoarthritis even late in life. Several chromosome regions have been previously linked to arthritis phenotypes in humans using either association studies in populations or linkage studies in families. It is interesting to note that several of these chromosome regions contain genes encoding different members of the BMP signaling pathway, including the <italic>BMP5</italic> gene on human chromosome 6p12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Loughlin1">Loughlin et al. 2002</xref>), the <italic>MADH1</italic> gene on human chromosome 4q26&#x02013;4q31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Leppavuori1">Leppavuori et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Kent1">Kent et al. 2002</xref>), and the <italic>BMPR2</italic> receptor on human chromosome 2q33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020355-Wright1">Wright et al. 1996</xref>). The complex nature of human osteoarthritis suggests that interactions between multiple genes may be involved in modifying susceptibility to the disease. The inclusion of genetic markers near BMP signaling components may help identify additional osteoarthritis susceptibility loci and facilitate the search for causative mutations.</p><p>Development and disease processes in synovial joints have been difficult to study genetically, because synovial joints are generated and function at relatively late stages of vertebrate development. The <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> system provides a new method for restricting gene expression or inactivation primarily to articular regions, thus avoiding the pleiotropic functions of many genes in other tissues. Depending on the configuration of the floxed target gene, this system can be used to either activate the expression of a gene primarily in developing joints (ssee <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g001">1</xref>D), or to inactivate gene function in articular regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020355-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Additional studies with this system should greatly enhance our knowledge of the development, function, and disease mechanisms of joints, and may bring us closer to better prevention and treatment of joint diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Generation of <italic>Gdf5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice</title><p>A mouse 129x1/SvJ BAC library (Invitrogen) was screened to identify a 140-kb BAC from the <italic>Gdf5</italic> locus.

Aliquots of fractions were run on a pulse-field gel and Southern blotted using vector-specific DNA as a probe. Fractions containing unsheared insert and almost no detectable vector DNA were dialyzed in microinjection buffer (10 mM Tris &#x0005b;pH 7.4&#x0005d; with 0.15 mM EDTA &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;) using Centriprep-30 concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States).

Grasping ability in 6-mo-old mice was measured by placing animals on a slender rod and timing how long they could remain suspended on the rod, to a maximum time allowed of 2 min. Data from five consecutive trials for each mouse were averaged. Range of motion assays were conducted on the MT/P1 and P1/P2 joints of the second hindlimb digit from euthanized 18-wk-old animals.
