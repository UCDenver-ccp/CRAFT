To date, there are very few reports describing species-specific splice variants. While identification of <italic>Mcoln1</italic> is crucial to the development of mouse models for MLIV, the fact that there are two transcripts in mice suggests an additional or alternate function of the gene that may complicate phenotypic assessment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV; MIM 252650) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is characterized by corneal clouding, delayed psychomotor development, and mental retardation that usually presents during the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Another interesting clinical characteristic is that patients are constitutively achlorhydric with associated hypergastremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patients with MLIV do not show mucopolysaccharide excretion, skeletal changes, or organomegaly like the other mucolipidoses. Abnormal lysosomal storage bodies and large vacuoles have been found in skin and conjuctival biopsies using electron-microscopy and, prior to gene identification, served as the only means of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A recent report estimates that the carrier frequency of MLIV in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is 1 in 100, and mutations have been reported in Jewish and non-Jewish families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The human gene <italic>MCOLN1</italic> (GenBank #AF287270) maps to chromosome 19p13.2-13.3 and encodes a novel protein that is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel gene superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Protein trafficking studies suggest that MLIV is the result of a defect in the late endocytic pathway, contrary to the other mucolipidoses which are typically caused by defective lysosomal hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent work in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> supports this hypothesis. Loss of function mutants of the <italic>MCOLN1 C. elegans</italic> homologue, <italic>cup-5,</italic> result in an increased rate of endocytosis, accumulation of large vacuoles, and a decreased rate of endocytosed protein breakdown; while over-expression of this gene reverses the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cloning and characterization of the mouse homologue of <italic>MCOLN1</italic> is crucial for the development of mouse models of MLIV to further study this disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cloning and mapping of the mouse homologue <italic>Mcoln1</italic></title><p>In order to clone the mouse homologue of <italic>MCOLN1,</italic> the human amino acid sequence was compared to the high throughput genomic sequence (HTGS) database using TBLASTN, which identified the mouse BAC clone RPCI-23_387H4 (GB No. AC079544.1). Correspondence with the Joint Genome Institute and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Human Genome Center confirmed the location of this BAC to mouse chromosome 8 and allowed us to construct a physical map of this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The BAC sequence was then compared to the mouse EST database using BLASTN, and multiple ESTs and their corresponding I.M.A.G.E. clones were identified.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Physical and transcript map of the <italic>Mcoln1</italic> gene region.

The 2.4 kb band shows ubiquitous but variable expression, with the highest expression in brain, liver and kidney. The fetal tissue blot shows decreasing levels of the 2.4 kb message with increasing gestational age. Since the human <italic>MCOLN1</italic> gene encodes a single transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we carried out additional hybridizations with probes generated from various regions of the coding sequence and 3' UTR, and all probes identified the same two transcripts in the mouse (data not shown). In order to verify the presence of a single mouse locus, we hybridized a mouse Southern blot with the exon 2 probe. Four different restriction enzymes were used, and only the expected size bands for the chromosome 8 locus were detected (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Northern analysis of <italic>Mcoln1.</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) Mouse fetal tissue Northern and (<bold>B</bold>) mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) hybridized with a probe generated from exon 2 (probe 1, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Two ESTs were identified that contained sequence from intron 12 (GB No. AI430291 and AA874645), and the corresponding clones were sequenced. Clone 408619 (ESTs: GB No. AI430291, AI429558) begins approximately 1.1 kb before exon 13 and continues through the exon and splices correctly to exon 14. Clone 1281641 (EST:GB No. AA874645) begins 175 bp before exon 13 and also splices correctly to exon 14. A mouse multiple tissue Northern was hybridized using a probe generated from the putative intron sequence in clone 408619 (Probe 2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which detected only the 4.4 kb band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine the sequence of the entire transcript, RT-PCR using primers in exons 10 and 11 paired with a primer in intron 12 was performed using BALB/c mouse brain total RNA and the resulting products sequenced. These products show that the larger transcript is due to an alternative splice event that results in an expanded exon 13. Specifically, exon 12 splices at bp 436 of intron 12, creating a large 1614 bp exon 13 that splices correctly to exon 14. The open reading frame of this alternatively spliced transcript is 611 amino acids, 28 amino acids longer than the message encoded by the 2.4 kb transcript.</p><p>TMPred analysis predicts that isoform 2 encodes a protein identical in structure to <italic>Mcoln1,</italic> possessing 6 transmembrane domains and a channel pore, however the protein sequences diverge at amino acid 526. The 55 amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail encoded by the 2.4 kb transcript is completely different from the 86 amino acid tail encoded by the murine specific 4.4 kb transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Clontech Mouse RNA Master Blots were hybridized with the exon 2 and intron 12 probes mentioned above in an attempt to determine if these two transcripts showed differences in expression patterns, however, there was no significant difference in the 22 tissues represented (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Peptide sequence comparison of the two alternatively spliced <italic>Mcoln1</italic> isoforms. The green box surrounds the divergent c-terminal cytoplasmic tails. The blue lines indicate the transmembrane domains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-3-3-4"/></fig><p>Next, we directly compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse transcript to the entire human <italic>MCOLN1</italic> genomic sequence and found no significant similarity. As mentioned previously, Northern blots performed with human <italic>MCOLN1</italic> probes show only one 2.4 kb transcript. In addition, we hybridized a human multiple tissue Northern and human Southern with a probe in human intron 12 that is adjacent to exon 13. The probe was located in the region syntenic to that which encodes the alternate mouse transcript. Only the expected bands were detected on the Southern and no bands were detected on the Northern, confirming that this alternative transcript is specific to murine <italic>Mcoln1.</italic> Recent BLASTP analysis of the alternate <italic>Mcoln1</italic> transcript yields a match to a putative 145 amino acid anonymous protein (GB No. BAB25862) predicted from a RIKEN clone. It is obvious from our results, however, that the identification of this sequence as a full-length protein is incorrect since probes unique to the clone, as well as probes containing the <italic>Mcoln1</italic> coding sequence, identify the same transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Comparison of <italic>Mcoln1</italic> isoform 1 to its human homologue shows striking similarity at both the amino acid and nucleotide level. All six of the transmembrane domains, as well as the putative cation channel are highly conserved. The putative di-leucine (L-L-X-X) motif at the C-terminus, which may act as a late endosomal/lysosomal targeting signal, is also conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This speculation is supported by work with <italic>cup-5</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the <italic>c. elegans</italic> homologue of <italic>MCOLN1,</italic> since cellular localization studies suggest that the protein is found in the late endosomes and/or lysosomes.</p><p>The mouse <italic>Mcoln1</italic> gene has two alternatively spliced isoforms, with isoform 2 having a different c-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The unique 86 amino acid c-terminal tail lacks the lysosomal targeting signal and does not contain any conserved domains when compared against the current profile databases. We speculate that this protein may have similar channel function but an alternate subcellular localization, but this must be proven once isoform-specific antibodies are raised. However, our results suggest that phenotypic assessment of <italic>Mcoln1</italic> knock-out mice may be complicated and that care must be taken when interpreting data on mouse gene expression and phenotype.</p><p>Interestingly, the second <italic>Mcoln1</italic> isoform is not seen in humans and the sequence of the alternatively spliced region is not conserved between man and mouse. To date, very few genes have been reported that show species specific alternative splice variants. MOG, myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, has many different splice variants in humans that are not found in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ATP11B, a P-type ATPase, has a rabbit-specific splice variant that deletes a transmembrane domain and therefore likely alters the putative function of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sequencing of the human genome has led to estimates of approximately 32,000 genes, a total surprise given the previous significantly higher estimates that were based on the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the public databases. This apparent disparity suggests a major role for alternative splicing in creating genetic complexity, and has brought the study of splicing regulation to the forefront of molecular genetics. It is likely that an abundance of species-specific splice variants will be identified as the characterization of alternatively spliced transcripts progresses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>We conducted database searches using BLAST <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast"/> and Draft Human Genome Browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/"/>.

Hybridizations and washes were carried out in standard conditions, with the stripping of previously bound probes in between [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grant NS39995.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amir</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Zlotogora</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bach</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mucolipidosis Type IV: Clinical Spectrum and Natural History.</article-title><source>Pediatrics</source><year>1987</year><volume>79</volume><fpage>953</fpage><lpage>959</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2438637</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schiffmann</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dwyer</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lubensky</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsokos</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sutliff</surname><given-names>VE</given-names></name><name><surname>Latimer</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Frei</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>RO</given-names></name><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>NW</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanchette-Mackie</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldin</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Constitive achlorohydria in mucolipidosis type IV.</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</source><year>1998</year><volume>95</volume><fpage>1207</fpage><lpage>1212</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9448310</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1073/pnas.95.3.1207</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Livni</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Shapira</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Merin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Levij</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Congenital corneal clouding with abnormal systemic storage bodies: a new variant of Mucolipidosis.</article-title><source>J Pediatr</source><year>1974</year><volume>84</volume><fpage>519</fpage><lpage>526</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4365943</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crandall</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name><name><surname>Philippart</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Blustone</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Review article: Mucolipidosis IV.</article-title><source>Am J Med Genet</source><year>1982</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>301</fpage><lpage>308</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7114093</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tellez-Nagel</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Iwamoto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Norton</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name><name><surname>Nitowsky</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mucolipidosis IV.
