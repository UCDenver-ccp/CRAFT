TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth. The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully, yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates, including RAD51, BLM, and RPA. These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1 and MLH3, and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes.

Our data indicate that TRIP13 is required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination events, but possibly not those destined to be crossovers.

During the process of meiosis, the maternal and paternal copies of each chromosome &#x0201c;synapse&#x0201d; with each other (become tightly associated), exchange genetic material via the process of recombination, then separate into daughter cells in the first of two meiotic cell divisions. The intricate chromosome behavior is subject to errors, so most organisms have evolved meiotic &#x0201c;checkpoints&#x0201d; that monitor fidelity of chromosome synapsis and repair of DNA damage.

Homologous chromosomes must pair, synapse, undergo recombination, and segregate properly to opposite poles. Recombination, which repairs repair double strand breaks (DSBs) that are genetically induced in leptonema, is coupled with synapsis in budding yeast and mammals. While our knowledge of the assembly and nature of recombination machinery is extensive, little is known about the disassembly of recombination intermediates, recruitment of DNA replication machinery during recombinational repair, and how the choice between different repair pathways is made.</p><p>Defects in recombination can preclude homologous chromosome pairing, leave unrepaired chromosome breaks, and cause aneuploidy by abrogating crossing over. To avoid such deleterious outcomes, surveillance systems (&#x0201c;checkpoints&#x0201d;) exist to sense meiotic errors and eliminate cells containing unresolved defects.

We found no evidence that it is involved in pachytene checkpoint control. Our data suggest that while recombination events destined to be resolved as COs can proceed normally in <italic>Trip13</italic> mutants, DSBs that enter the NCO repair pathway are incompletely resolved or processed inefficiently. This hypothesis is compatible with current knowledge of meiotic recombination pathways. In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> CO and NCO pathways are distinct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;; they have different recombination intermediates, and are dependent upon different proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

As in yeast, both require SPO11-induced breaks, but only the CO pathway requires MLH1. Both types of recombinant products are formed by mid-late pachynema. Another possibility is that the recombination defects are a result of defective intersister recombination. However, this type of DSB repair is suppressed in meiotic cells. Ablation of <italic>RAD54,</italic> which mediates intersister recombination in yeast, does not significantly disrupt meiosis in either yeast or mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, RAD54-deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of RAD51 foci on pachytene chromosomes, similar to those in TRIP13 mice, but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Data from budding yeast also indicate that Pch2p functions in recombination. Deletion of <italic>PCH2</italic> delays meiotic progression by &#x0223c;2 h in SK1 yeast, and causes a minor decrease in ascus formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. DSBs persist &#x0003e;2 h longer in <italic>pch2</italic>&#x00394; yeast than in wild type, and hyperresection of DSBs in <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pch2</italic>&#x00394; double mutants is lower than in <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, it was reported that <italic>pch2</italic>&#x00394; yeast had a meiosis I delay dependent on the <italic>RAD17&#x02013;SAE2</italic> checkpoint that monitors recombination intermediates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the exact role of TRIP13 (or Pch2) in recombination is unclear. Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation (activity of SPO11 and MEI1), we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and strand exchange, and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so (because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes). One possibility for TRIP13&#x02032;s role in recombination is that it is directly involved in a step specific to resolution of NCO recombination intermediates. Another possibility is that TRIP13 is required for disassembly of NCO recombinational repair complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; containing those proteins that persist abnormally on <italic>Trip13<sup>Gt/Gt</sup></italic> pachytene chromosomes. Notably, TRIP13 has two putative ATPase domains, a signature of AAA-ATPase ClpA/B chaperones that perform protein or protein/DNA complex disassembly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. These potential recombination roles might not be limited to meiosis, since <italic>Trip13</italic> is widely transcribed and the mutant animals exhibited developmental defects. Finally, TRIP13 might play an indirect role, such as providing a &#x0201c;licensing&#x0201d; signal for the resolution of NCO intermediates and completion of meiosis.</p><p>Regarding the cause of cell death in <italic>Trip13</italic> mutants, our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis. We base this conclusion on two observations: (1) oocyte elimination is dependent upon DSB formation and (2) synapsis is normal in spermatocytes of adult testes. Indeed, this mutant is unique in that recombination defects occur in the absence of asynapsis (e.g., as in <italic>Dmc1</italic> knockouts). Thus, the <italic>Trip13</italic> mutant provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the mammalian pachytene checkpoint response. Furthermore, our results allow us to conclude that oocytes and spermatocytes share a similar, if not identical, DNA damage pachytene checkpoint that is decoupled from a synapsis checkpoint.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that OA treatment of <italic>Trip13<sup>Gt/Gt</sup></italic> spermatocytes could propel them into MI, despite a report that the same did not occur when wild-type pachytene spermatocytes were treated with the DSB-inducing agents gamma radiation or etoposide &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that the nascent induction of DSBs in pachynema evokes a checkpoint response that cannot be bypassed by OA, whereas the post-strand invasion lesions in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes do not.</p><p>TRIP13 was originally discovered to be an interactor with rat thyroid receptor beta (THRB; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;), but the relationship between THRB and TRIP13 in meiosis is unknown. Interestingly, we observed that THRB is distributed diffusely throughout wild-type spermatocyte nuclei but is excluded from the XY (sex) body (unpublished observations), a compartmentalized nuclear domain beginning in pachynema, in which the sex chromosomes become heterochromatinized and transcriptionally silenced in the process of MSCI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the XY body appeared intact in most mutant spermatocytes upon probing with several markers of XY heterochromatinization (unpublished observations). Considering that THRB knockout mice are viable and fertile &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, the functional relationship between TRIP13 and its receptor THRB in meiosis is unclear.</p><p>Given the high similarity of PCH2 orthologs throughout the eukaryotic world, one or more essential functions of this protein must be conserved. Since TRIP13 does not exhibit checkpoint function in mice, we surmise that the TRIP13/PCH2 ancestral protein had a function in recombination that persists to the present. Notably, <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates mutant meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice, budding yeast, and female <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, and mammalian TRIP13 is more similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PCH2 than the fly or worm proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030130-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and S1). The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function (namely recombination, although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined), and the absence of checkpoint function. Nevertheless, the evolutionary relationships between animals, fungi, and plants (which are discordant with PCH2 sequence phylogeny) do not allow parsimonious models addressing the points in time that checkpoint functions in PCH2 were gained or lost. It is possible that its checkpoint function evolved independently in worms and budding yeast. The picture will become clearer as the function of PCH2 in other organisms is elucidated.</p><p>The nature of the synapsis checkpoint in male mice remains unidentified. One possible candidate is <italic>Dot1</italic> (<italic>PCH1</italic> in yeast), a histone methyltransferase silencing factor that is required for pachytene arrest of <italic>zip1</italic> and <italic>dmc1</italic> mutants in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, and for preventing RAD54-mediated recombinational DSB repair between sister chromatids. However, <italic>DOT1</italic> acts upstream of <italic>PCH2</italic>. Given that TRIP13 doesn't have checkpoint function in mice, a potential role for mammalian DOT1 in the pachytene checkpoint is dubious but awaits investigation. Recently, it was shown that the TRP53 homolog TRP63 is required for DNA damage&#x02013;induced death of dictyate-stage primordial oocytes, leading to the suggestion that it is involved in monitoring genome integrity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this activity occurs subsequent to a pachytene checkpoint. As alluded to earlier, a complicating problem for studying potential meiotic checkpoint genes in mice is that as in yeast, such genes often have mitotic functions (such as RAD24 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;), and their ablation can cause lethality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030130-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Unless mammalian pachytene checkpoint components have orthologs with similar functions in organisms such as yeast, their identities are likely to remain elusive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>PCR analysis of <italic>Trip13</italic> cDNA.</title><p><italic>Trip13</italic> was amplified from samples of Clontech's Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel I (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clontech.com">http://www.clontech.com</ext-link>), using the following primers: 5&#x02032;-GCACCATTGCACTTCACATC-3&#x02032; (TRP3-6F) and 5&#x02032;-TGACCATCAGACTGTCGAGC-3&#x02032; (TRP3-6R).
