Yet in most vertebrate tissues it is unclear which Hh-responses are the direct result of Hh action on a particular cell type because Hhs frequently elicit secondary signals. In developing skeletal muscle, Hhs promote slow myogenesis in zebrafish and are involved in specification of medial muscle cells in amniote somites. However, the extent to which non-myogenic cells, myoblasts or differentiating myocytes are direct or indirect targets of Hh signalling is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) can act directly on cultured C2 myoblasts, driving Gli1 expression, myogenin up-regulation and terminal differentiation, even in the presence of growth factors that normally prevent differentiation. Distinct myoblasts respond differently to Shh: in some slow myosin expression is increased, whereas in others Shh simply enhances terminal differentiation. Exposure of chick wing bud cells to Shh in culture increases numbers of both muscle and non-muscle cells, yet simultaneously enhances differentiation of myoblasts. The small proportion of differentiated muscle cells expressing definitive slow myosin can be doubled by Shh. Shh over-expression in chick limb bud reduces muscle mass at early developmental stages while inducing ectopic slow muscle fibre formation. Abundant later-differentiating fibres, however, do not express extra slow myosin. Conversely, Hh loss of function in the limb bud, caused by implanting hybridoma cells expressing a functionally blocking anti-Hh antibody, reduces early slow muscle formation and differentiation, but does not prevent later slow myogenesis. Analysis of Hh knockout mice indicates that Shh promotes early somitic slow myogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, the data show that Hh can have direct pro-differentiative effects on myoblasts and that early-developing muscle requires Hh for normal differentiation and slow myosin expression. We propose a simple model of how direct and indirect effects of Hh regulate early limb myogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Each muscle in a developing chick limb acquires a unique character from its inception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Fibres form by the terminal differentiation of dividing myoblasts that elongate in particular orientations to form specific attachments to the skeleton. Simultaneously, the fibres of each muscle take on gene expression patterns characteristic of their future function. For example, those muscles destined to maintain body posture express certain isoforms of slow myosin from their inception, whereas future fast muscle regions fail to express this slow myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been suggested that distinct cell lineages underlie the formation of slow and fast muscle fibres, and much evidence for myoblast heterogeneity has been obtained from studies both in vitro and in vivo [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]]. Nevertheless, it is clear that for fibres to undergo differentiation at the appropriate time and place extrinsic cues must regulate muscle patterning.</p><p>Work on muscle patterning in somites over the past decade has shown that various protein factors secreted by adjacent tissues act as extrinsic signals regulating the formation and fate of myogenic cells [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]]. One such factor is Sonic hedgehog (Shh), derived from the ventral midline, which is required for expression of markers of the earliest population of myogenic cells in the medial somite of both birds and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These medial somitic cells contribute to the early-born muscle fibres of the myotome, but their subsequent fate is not known in amniotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Ventral midline Hedgehog (Hh) signals are also required for formation of the earliest muscle cells in the zebrafish embryo, the adaxial slow cells [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]]. The fate of these cells is known, they generate a population of slow muscle fibres that migrate to form a layer of slow muscle that covers the lateral surface of the somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In all vertebrates examined, a second myogenic cell population arises in the lateral somite by a distinct Hh-independent genetic pathway in response to signals from more lateral and dorsal tissues. Signals such as FGFs, BMPs and WNTs and their antagonists are prime candidates for patterning of lateral somitic cells, at least in amniotes [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]]. Wnt proteins from dorsal tissues are also implicated in medial myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the somite, induction of precursor myoblast populations is occurring close in space and time to terminal differentiation of myoblasts into contractile fibres. This makes analysis of the precise effects of extrinsic signals hard to determine. For example, Shh can promote both primary myogenesis and subsequent cell survival in somitic explants and in vivo, but the precise target cell populations are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast, in the limb bud myogenic induction and terminal differentiation are temporally and spatially separated. Myogenic cells of the limb derive from a population of precursors that migrates into the limb bud from the lateral somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These cells already express genes required for myogenesis prior to their migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Evidence suggests that several distinct populations of myogenic cells enter the limb bud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Thus, muscle formation within the limb bud omits some of the early steps that occur in the somites. Consequently, we chose the somewhat simpler and more accessible limb bud to analyse the effects of Hh on the differentiation and patterning of muscle fibre types.</p><p>Previous work has shown that early manipulations that alter limb anteroposterior axis formation and skeletal pattern, including Shh mis-expression, change muscle and fibre type pattern in parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, myoblast clones appear uncommitted to a particular character either early or late in myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] indicating that local signals control fibre pattern. Nevertheless, implantation of cloned myoblasts into limbs can alter fibre pattern, although in such experiments it is difficult to rule out implantation of cells that are already undergoing terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Myoblast implantation at later stages shows that local limb signals can re-programme myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is clear that Hh expression within the limb at these later stages does not have a spatial pattern that is well correlated with formation of individual muscles or fibre types. Nevertheless, augmenting Hh signalling in a way that does not affect anteroposterior axis formation severely disrupts muscle patterning and differentiation leading to enlarged but disorganised muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Conversely, a dramatic loss of muscle is observed in Shh-deficient mouse limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Interpretation of these Hh results has differed, possibly because muscle is not the only tissue affected. Moreover, these studies do not distinguish direct effects of Hh on myogenic cells from indirect effects acting via non-myogenic cell populations in the limb. In the current paper, we use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to analyse the effect of Hh on muscle differentiation and slow fibre formation. We establish definitively using in vitro cultures that myoblasts can be directly induced to terminal differentiation by Shh. Moreover, Shh enhances slow myosin accumulation. With these in vitro results in mind, in vivo analysis of limbs with increased or decreased Hh signalling indicates that Hh is a muscle differentiation factor that promotes early slow myogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Shh promotes myogenesis in limb monolayer culture</title><p>We examined Shh action on wing myogenic cells by exposing limb bud cells to Shh in monolayer cultures, in which we hoped the effects of secondary signals elicited by Shh action on non-myogenic cell populations would be minimized. Wing buds were dissociated at HH22 and grown in growth medium either in the presence or absence of Shh-containing conditioned medium. After two days (the equivalent of HH28), Shh-treated cultures are noticeably more dense (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical detection of desmin, a marker of myogenic cells, shows that myogenic and non-myogenic cells increase in parallel on Shh exposure, so that the proportion of myogenic cells remains unaltered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, control cultures seeded at higher density show a reduced overall proportion of myogenic cells compared to low density control cultures, suggesting that interactions between cells in high density cultures repress myogenic cell accumulation. Nevertheless, even at high density, the proportion of myogenic cells is maintained on exposure to Shh, demonstrating an increase in desmin<sup>+ </sup>cell number (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,1B</xref>). We next examined pan-MyHC immunoreactivity, a marker of differentiated myocytes and myotubes. In all control cultures, ~50% of myogenic cells express MyHC. With Shh, this proportion increases to ~70% in low and ~85% in high density cultures, equivalent to a threefold increase in absolute numbers of differentiated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, Shh enhances both number and terminal differentiation of chick limb bud myogenic cells, confirming results on explant cultures of limb and somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Shh induces terminal differentiation and slow MyHC in wing primary cultures. </bold>Dissociated cells HH22 wing bud cells were plated at low or high density and grown for two days in the absence (white bars) or presence of Shh-conditioned medium (ShhQT6 CM, black bars) or control CM (QT6 CM, grey bars) and the number of total (A), desmin-reactive (B), pan-MyHC-reactive (C) and slow MyHC-reactive (D) cells determined.

The proportion of desmin-expressing myogenic cells was unchanged by Shh, at either low or high cell density. Note that the proportion of myogenic cells declined at high density, consistent with faster proliferation of non-myogenic cells. <bold>C</bold>. The proportion of differentiated myogenic cells (defined as the fraction of nuclei within desmin-containing cytoplasm that were in MyHC-containing cytoplasm) increased with Shh, irrespective of density. <bold>D</bold>. With Shh more differentiated cells express slow MyHC (defined as the fraction of nuclei within MyHC-containing cytoplasm that were in slow MyHC-containing cytoplasm). Note that even the high density culture has more total slow MyHC expressing cells because the same proportion of an increased number of differentiated cells express slow MyHC. ** P &#x02264; 0.002 compared to control(s), t-test on cell numbers after correcting for change in numerator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-4-9-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Shh can directly induce muscle terminal differentiation</title><p>Experiments using limb bud cells do not exclude an indirect effect of Shh, as non-myogenic cell types are present in the culture. Nor do such experiments resolve whether Shh directly promotes myoblast terminal differentiation, proliferation or both, or acts by preventing apoptosis. We next tried to isolate clones of myoblasts from early chick wing buds, but despite repeated attempts this proved impossible, probably due to the known difficulty of cloning embryonic chick myoblasts combined with the low abundance of myogenic cells in early wing buds. So the effect of Shh exposure was tested on the adult mouse-derived C2C12 myoblast cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). All three C2C12-derived myoblast lines tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] respond to Shh treatment by increased terminal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). No change in cell density is apparent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), nor is BrdU incorporation altered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). No change in TUNEL, acridine orange or Annexin V staining is ever observed (data not shown). Therefore, Shh can act directly on these myoblasts to promote terminal differentiation.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Shh increases C2 myoblast differentiation. </bold>C2 cells were exposed to ShhQT6 conditioned or control QT6 conditioned medium during both growth and differentiation. <bold>A</bold>.

Quantitative comparison of enhanced differentiation of C2 myoblast lines in response to Shh calculated as the number of nuclei within MyHC-containing cytoplasm (i.e. number of differentiated myocytes). Note that the effect of Shh appears more dramatic if the proportion of nuclei in MyHC-containing cytoplasm is measured, because Shh-treated wells have the same or fewer total cells. For example, in one experiment C2/4 cells showed around 44% differentiation compared to ~6% in controls although across all experiments cell numbers were not significantly affected by Shh treatment. <bold>C</bold>.

Thus, if C2 myoblasts respond directly to Shh they would be expected to show elevated levels of <italic>gli </italic>gene transcription. The addition of Shh up-regulates <italic>gli1 </italic>transcripts in over 50% of C2 myoblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), but does not induce <italic>gli2 </italic>expression (data not shown). Thus, C2 cells appear to be responsive to Shh through the normal Shh response pathway.</p><p>To examine the mechanisms involved in the Shh response we determined the effect of Shh on C2 cells in growth factor-rich medium, which normally maintains C2 myoblasts in the cell cycle and inhibits terminal differentiation. Control cultures have low levels of nuclear MyoD protein, very little Myogenin and only rare MyHC-containing cells. However, after two days of Shh treatment, C2 cells show enhanced MyoD protein accumulation in many nuclei and a markedly higher frequency of groups of Myogenin immunoreactive cells, some of which also contain detectable MyHC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Shh, therefore, can drive nuclear MyoD accumulation and terminal differentiation of myoblasts even in the presence of growth factors found in serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Shh can directly promote slow fibre formation</title><p>When wing bud cultures are analysed for expression of slow MyHC, the vast majority of differentiated muscle cells fail to express detectable slow MyHC, just as nascent fibres do not express slow MyHC at the initiation of myogenesis in vivo (see below). In control low density cultures, a small proportion of differentiated cells (1&#x02013;2%, defined as the proportion of nuclei within MyHC-containing cytoplasm that are in slow MyHC-containing cytoplasm) contain slow MyHC, detected by A4.840 immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Shh exposure doubles the proportion of myocyte/myotubes expressing slow MyHC to ~4%, which corresponds to a six-fold increase in absolute numbers of slow MyHC-reactive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). However, in high density culture, slow MyHC is suppressed in controls and Shh fails to induce an increase in the proportion of cells expressing slow MyHC.</p><p>The small rise in cultured wing cells expressing slow MyHC from ~1&#x02013;2% to ~4% of total myocytes suggested that a sub-population of myogenic cells might be induced to express slow MyHC by Shh. However, as with overall terminal differentiation, selective cell survival and/or indirect effects of Shh could not be ruled out. To avoid these criticisms, we again turned to C2 cells. Two lines of C2 cells, C2C12 and C2/4, express very little slow MyHC after three days differentiation. Shh exposure did not induce slow MyHC in these cells, despite their Shh responsiveness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and data not shown). However, another line of C2C12 cells, designated C2X, expresses a low level of slow MyHC in 5&#x02013;15% of myocytes in the absence of Shh (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Exposure to Shh during two days of proliferation in growth medium and a subsequent three day period in differentiation medium enhances differentiation to a similar extent to that in other C2C12 lines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B,3D</xref>). In addition, the frequency and intensity of slow MyHC-reactivity in myocytes increases dramatically to above 30% of differentiated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3C,3D</xref>). Both effects of Shh conditioned medium on C2X cells are blocked by addition of the anti-Hh antibody 5E1, confirming that Shh is the inducing component of the medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,3C</xref>). Purified Shh also up-regulates slow MyHC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Despite the ability of 5E1 to block the activity of exogenously applied Shh, it does not reduce baseline slow MyHC expression, suggesting that the low level of slow MyHC expressed in these cells is not due to autocrine exposure to a Hh signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). After Shh exposure, a very similar proportion of mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleate myocytes contain slow MyHC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), indicating that increased fusion is not responsible for the extra slow MyHC. We conclude that Shh can act on this murine myoblast cell line to induce both terminal differentiation and slow MyHC accumulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Shh promotes slow differentiation</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

This effect was blocked by addition of the 5E1 (1:300 diluted from 1.9 mg/ml) functionally-blocking anti-Shh monoclonal antibody, although basal differentiation and slow MyHC expression in control myocytes was unaffected.

First, we characterised developing chick wing buds with respect to slow MyHC expression using several monoclonal antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As we have described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], myogenesis in the zeugopod (forearm region) commences at HH25 in both ventral and dorsal muscle mass (DMM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). At HH27/28, slow MyHC is detectable in both muscle masses. Two anti-slow MyHC antibodies, Na8 and A4.840, detect a subset of muscle fibres within the DMM running from the posterior of proximal DMM to the middle of the distal DMM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4C,4D,4E,4F,4G,4H,4I,4J,4K</xref>). This pattern is similar to that previously reported for the product of the SMHC2 gene, a definitive marker of slow fibres in adult chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. By contrast, anti-slow MyHC antibody BA-D5 is expressed in most, if not all, early fibres, consistent with the reported expression pattern of SMHC1 gene product in all early primary fibres of the chick embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,4I</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. At HH31, all three anti-slow MyHC antibodies react in both DMM and VMM, with a pattern approximately reciprocal with a neonatal/fast MyHC antibody N3.36, consistent with previous results using other antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Slow MyHC is most abundant in the posterior proximal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and medial distal (data not shown) regions of the former DMM, which have split into individual muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L,4M,4N</xref>). Thus, BA-D5 immunoreactivity is lost within some muscles of the dorsal compartment, but is retained in the region that initially expressed the Na8 and A4.840-reactive MyHCs. Consequently, antibodies Na8 and/or A4.840 were used in all subsequent studies to mark definitive slow muscle.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Early formation of a restricted group of slow MyHC-expressing fibres in the chick forewing. </bold><bold>A</bold>.

Among treated wings, three classes of outcome are observed. In ~50% (8/15) wings, there was a complete loss of muscle tissue in the posterior region of the dorsal zone and reduced muscle in the anterior region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,5H</xref>). In another ~30% (4/15) wings, the DMM had altered shape and a variable reduction in the total number of differentiated fibres in the region of Shh accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,5H</xref>). The three remaining Shh/RCAS wings revealed no phenotype, correlated with low ectopic Shh protein and young age (data not shown). In all affected wings, the anterior DMM that would not normally express any slow MyHC contained significant levels of slow MyHC, such that the proportion of all fibres that contained slow MyHC was doubled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F,5I,5J</xref>). In most operated wings showing a muscle phenotype, Shh was detectable in or close to the DMM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>, arrowhead). The location of highest ectopic Shh correlated with loss of muscle fibres in severely-affected wings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,5F,5G</xref>; arrowheads).

Anti-Hh hybridoma cells cause a reduction in limb cross sectional area by 15% (P &#x0003c; 0.001, n = 14, 0.64 to 0.55 mm<sup>2</sup>), whereas control hybridoma cells have no effect. Overall DMM area is also reduced at HH27/28 but without obvious change in location or shape. However, the initial appearance of slow MyHC is more severely reduced or blocked entirely compared to contralateral control limbs (7/9 limbs at HH27/29, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,7B,7C,7D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The effect of the implant is generally more severe in younger limbs, but in all affected cases extended over at least 480 &#x003bc;m of the zeugopod (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). We next quantified slow MyHC-expressing fibres in at least four sections spaced by 120 &#x003bc;m within each limb in comparison to contralateral control limbs at the same proximodistal level. At HH27/28 or 28 anti-Hh treated limbs showed a 79% (&#x000b1; 12% SEM, n = 4) reduction in slow fibres. More mature treated limbs at HH28/29 showed a lesser reduction of 27% (&#x000b1; 19% SEM, n = 5). In even older limbs (HH30), there is a reduction in DMM extent in the zeugopod region of anti-Hh treated limbs (4/4 limbs, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E,7F,7G,7H</xref>). However, slow MyHC is not noticably reduced (4/4 limbs, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E,7F,7G,7H</xref>). Limb outgrowth and digit formation are unaffected at any stage (data not shown), suggesting that the anti-Hh antibody does not reach sufficient titre to prevent ZPA activity. Although implants were generally found within the elbow or stylopod region, changes in stylopod muscle are less marked than in zeugopod (data not shown), consistent with a diminished role for Hh in the later stages of stylopod muscle formation. Control hybridoma cells (encoding a high-titre IgG1 anti-MyHC antibody N2.261) have no significant effect on any parameter examined (6 limbs, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I,7J</xref>).

However, later implants had lesser effects on muscle growth (4/4, data not shown), arguing that Hh has less role in later myogenesis. To examine the issue more definitively, we turned to mice lacking Hh genes. In the mouse, many slow fibres arise in deep regions of the limb near to the source of Ihh from developing long bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. As in other mammals, only a single slow MyHC gene is known in mice, but primary slow fibres do fall into two distinct populations with different innervation and fate: deep fibres remain slow, superficial ones turn fast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We, therefore, examined myogenesis in mice lacking <italic>Ihh </italic>at a stage when deep slow fibres display their unique character. Hindlimb elongation is severely reduced in these animals, and this is accompanied by a decrease in muscle tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). However, forelimb growth is relatively normal, and so is limb muscle content and pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). No obvious lack of slow MyHC is observed in either fore- or hindlimbs of <italic>Ihh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,9B</xref>).

In wild-type E9.5 mice, around 12 rostral somites contain differentiated muscle fibres expressing MyHC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). Slow fibres were observed in rostral somites, but not in the two-three caudalmost MyHC-expressing somites (n = 6 mice). In rostral somites, many fibres lacked slow MyHC, but expressed embryonic MyHC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref> and data not shown). This confirms that embryonic MyHC is acquired before slow MyHC in early muscle fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].

Among residual fibres slow MyHC was undetectable in most animals (5/6; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). The single animal containing slow MyHC was developmentally more advanced, based on the presence of MyHC in more somites. Thus lack of Shh in somites leads to reduced early differentiation and delayed slow MyHC accummulation, as observed in chick limbs treated with anti-Hh antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Hitherto, all studies of the actions of Hh on amniote muscle have failed to rule out indirect effects deriving, for example, from Hh eliciting secondary signals from adjacent non-muscle cells. Here we show that Hh can directly promote terminal differentiation and slow MyHC accumulation by at least some myoblasts in cell culture. We find that Hh is required for the earliest definitive slow myogenesis in chick limb buds and use this new understanding to develop a simple model of a role of Hh signalling in limb myogenesis.</p><sec><title>Hh directly induces muscle differentiation</title><p>The results presented show that Shh can promote the terminal differentiation of muscle fibres both in vivo and in vitro. Our observation that Shh promotes terminal differentiation of C2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) definitively demonstrates that Shh can be a myoblast differentiation factor, at least on this adult muscle-derived cell line. This effect occurs even in the presence of growth factors. Early limb myogenic cells in culture also respond to Shh exposure by increased differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We also observed increase of muscles in Shh-treated limb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This is consistent with the numerous reports showing that Shh increases muscle differentiation in explant cultures or in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Conversely, and crucially, we find that local reduction of Hh function in the chick wing reduces muscle differentiation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This suggests that lack of Shh-driven myoblast differentiation may contribute to the severe reduction of muscle in early limb and somites in <italic>shh </italic>deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It is, therefore, highly likely that one action of Hh is the direct promotion of myoblast differentiation in developing chick wing bud.</p><p>A direct action of Hh on myoblasts is also supported by the rapid accumulation of <italic>gli1 </italic>mRNA, a downstream target of Hh signalling, in C2 cells and in limbs. In unmanipulated chicks, significant levels of <italic>ptc1 </italic>and <italic>gli1 </italic>mRNA accumulate in muscle masses, being highest in the posterior DMM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests that myogenic cells in both wing DMM and somite are exposed to Hh signals around the time of their first differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p><p>Which Hh could promote muscle differentiation in limbs? As the anti-Hh antibody blocks the function of both Shh and Ihh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], our in vivo manipulations do not address this issue. Ihh is an obvious candidate, as <italic>ptc1 </italic>and <italic>gli1 </italic>expression are up-regulated in the posterior DMM at the time and location of commencement of <italic>Ihh </italic>expression in cartilage anlage around HH27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, forelimb myogenesis in <italic>Ihh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice appears relatively normal, although we can not rule out undetected transient defects. Even in <italic>Ihh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>hindlimb, where muscle differentiation is greatly reduced, it is impossible to ascribe this reduction to a direct action of Ihh because failure of long bone elongation could prevent muscle growth through lack of stretch-induced hypertrophy signals. Similarly, Shh is not absolutely required for the initiation of some murine limb muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, <italic>gli1 </italic>expression suggests that Shh signalling extends quite far into what we have called the pre-myogenic zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] in the distal limb until at least HH27/28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). So differentiating myogenic cells may also be exposed to low levels of Shh. In zebrafish somites, distinct levels of Hh signalling elicited by the combined action of at least three Hh genes lead to different myogenic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. So the additive effects of Ihh and Shh, perhaps having different effects at particular overall concentrations, likely contribute to the sculpting of muscle differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Hh and slow myogenesis</title><p>We found that Shh has a consistent positive effect on slow myoblast differentiation. Differentiating chick wing myocytes express slow MyHC more frequently after Shh exposure in vitro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) or Shh over-expression in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Conversely, an early effect of blocking Hh in the wing is failure of slow MyHC accumulation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). And <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice have delayed slow MyHC accumulation in somites, perhaps due to loss of an early fibre population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Lastly, one line of C2 cells accumulates more slow MyHC after Shh exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Other C2 lines that do not express significant levels of slow MyHC in control conditions fail to up-regulate slow MyHC in response to Hh, perhaps indicating that Hh is unable to open the slow MyHC genomic locus. Both zebrafish and Xenopus embryos require Hh signalling to make some early populations of slow fibres, but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. This argues strongly that Hh-driven slow myogenesis is an ancestral character of amniotes. Nevertheless, as in lower vertebrates, slow fibre formation does eventually occur in amniotes with defective Hh signalling. Indeed, considering the complex pattern of slow and fast fibres in older muscle, it is clear that many factors in addition to Hh must be involved in establishing the pattern. Our evidence suggests that Hh acts primarily during the earliest stages of limb myogenesis.</p><p>What is the relationship between the differentiation-promoting and slow MyHC-promoting actions of Shh on C2 cells? Whereas intracellular signalling and terminal differentiation was triggered rapidly in all C2 cells, slow MyHC up-regulation required longer Shh exposure. Therefore, one can argue that differential cell survival could account for the Shh-dependent increase in slow MyHC, particularly as Shh, or tissues that secrete it, have been shown to promote survival of some myogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. However, we think a purely survival effect is unlikely, for several reasons. First, slow MyHC accumulation in single cells is greater with Shh, suggesting induction rather than simply enhanced survival. Second, assays for apoptosis in our C2 cultures revealed very little cell death, and this was unaffected by Shh exposure (unpublished result). Third, blockade of Hh in the wing bud reduces slow MyHC without a proportional reduction in differentiated muscle (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Fourth, Hh over-expression in vivo induces ectopic slow while simultaneously reducing total differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Fifth, in cultured zebrafish blastomeric cells, some of which spontaneously form muscle, Shh induces conversion to a slow fate without affecting cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Conversely, reduction of Hh signalling in zebrafish prevents slow myogenesis without inducing cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. As altered cell survival does not explain the differentiation promoting activity of Hh, it seems unnecessary to invoke it in regard to slow myogenesis. In C2 cells, blockade of apoptosis appears unlikely to explain the slow promoting activity of Hh, leaving promotion of slow differentiation as the prime explanation. In vivo, the potential combination of direct and indirect effects of Hh, possibly on several myoblast subsets, make attribution of direct effects to Hh action on myoblasts impossible (see below). Nevertheless, our in vitro findings highlight direct induction of slow differentiation by Hh as a mechanism requiring serious consideration.</p><p>Could simply enhancing terminal differentiation account for the increase in slow? In vivo manipulations fail to reveal a correlation between increased slow expression and enhanced differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Nor do the number of nuclei in a cultured myotube (a rough assay of maturity) predict whether slow MyHC is induced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Indeed, C2/4 cells differentiate well in response to Shh but fail to show the up-regulation of slow MyHC elicited by Shh in C2X cells, which differentiate less extensively with or without Shh. In addition, not all myoblasts in any line respond similarly to Shh exposure. It seems probable, therefore, that both intrinsic and micro-environmental differences between myoblasts regulate their response to Shh and could influence whether the response is simply terminal differentiation, or includes other events, such as slow MyHC accumulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Myoblast hetereogeneity of response to Hh</title><p>Intrinsic myoblast heterogeneity, possibly based on cell lineage, may also influence Hh response. As with C2 cells, not all cultured chick limb bud myoblasts respond similarly to Shh exposure. Shh efficiently enhanced terminal differentiation from 50% to ~80% of myogenic cells, showing that at least 30% of myogenic cells are likely to be Shh-responsive. However, only a few percent of chick myoblasts acquired slow MyHC in response to Shh (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Early limb myogenic cells have distinct clonally-heritable tendencies to either express slow MyHC or not do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. We suggest that, while most myoblasts may be Shh sensitive, sub-populations may respond differently based on their intrinsic capacity. This view parallels that of Stockdale and colleagues based on experiments showing differences in the myoblast populations forming distinct limb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Fibres in distinct muscles differ in slow MyHC from their inception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. So it is possible, by analogy with the situation in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] that the increase in slow fibres reflects a change in muscle identity of founder myoblasts, rather than a direct induction of slow MyHC. Altered myoblast identity could contribute to the failure of muscle splitting after Shh over-expression in vivo. Thus, by showing differential effects of Shh on distinct clonal myoblast lines that parallel those in primary cultures and in vivo (see below), our findings indicate that cell intrinsic differences determine the response of myogenic cells to Hh.</p><p>In the zeugopod, the earliest muscle differentiation is reduced, but not ablated, by introduction of anti-Hh antibody or in <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]). Hh signalling is required for some but not all early somitic myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This shows that some myoblast populations do not require Hh for differentiation. In later limbs, blocking Hh reduces fibre formation and extra Shh augments differentiation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Similarly, Hh blockade reduces slow MyHC and Shh over-expression augments slow fibres early, but has little or no effect on slow MyHC expression in later muscle. Taken together, these observations indicate that myoblasts generating the earliest fibres in the zeugopod (before about HH28) may respond differently to Hh from those contributing to DMM growth after this stage. Many limb signals other than Hhs undoubtedly influence muscle pattern and likely affect the response to Hh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Resolution of whether myoblast lineage or environmental effects underlie this difference will be important.</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect proliferative effects of Hh on myogenic cells</title><p>Direct pro-differentiative effects of Hh on some myoblasts do not rule out other direct or indirect effects of Hh. Our results confirm and extend previous reports showing that Shh can induce proliferation of myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], both in limb buds and in primary cultures. However, other cell types are affected in limbs because Shh-treated limbs are bigger (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). There is good evidence for effects of Hh on non-myogenic limb tissue. Shh over-expression causes limb hypertrophy with up-regulation of <italic>ptc1 </italic>and <italic>gli1 </italic>outside muscle masses and increase in non-myogenic tissue area (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similarly, Shh causes growth of non-myogenic as well as myogenic cells in our chick primary cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and in somite explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Conversely, inhibition of Hh in wing with anti-Hh antibody reduces limb growth in addition to reducing muscle mass size: this effect is first noticeable in non-muscle tissue (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Nobody has reported a proliferative effect of Shh on myoblasts independently of a proliferative effect on other cells. On the contrary, in the C2 cell line we clearly found no mitogenic effect of Shh (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Moreover, in zebrafish, Shh is not a mitogen for slow muscle precursors: muscle differentiation is delayed in the <italic>sonic-you </italic>mutants that lack Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and induced in embryos over-expressing Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, either chick wing cells respond differently to Shh compared with other myoblasts or mitogenic effects of Shh on myoblasts are indirect. It is highly likely that Hh action on non-myogenic cells leads to release of myoblast mitogens. One hypothesis has already proposed that Shh acts through BMPs to amplify the number of myogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and BMP induction by Ihh causes cartilage proliferation indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. So the temporary inhibition of terminal differentiation by Shh over-expression in limbs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]) may be a consequence of an indirect effect of Hh signalling on myoblast proliferation.</p><p>Combining our results with published data, we propose a model in which Hh promotes muscle differentiation directly in myoblasts within the muscle masses. But Hh also promotes myoblast proliferation indirectly by eliciting muscle growth factors from non-myogenic limb cells. This hypothesis explains how Hh may contribute to growth of muscle masses by increasing myoblasts at the edge, where proliferative signals from non-myogenic cells would predominate over the direct differentiative signal. Deeper within the muscle mass, pro-differentiative signals including Hh would be in the ascendant, adding new primary fibres at the periphery of the existing differentiated zone. At early stages distinct levels of Hh signalling may trigger slow myogenesis, possibly in sub-populations of myoblasts. Once muscle splitting commences Hh signalling declines, as indicated by reduced <italic>gli1 </italic>expression, and other influences probably determine the decision of later myoblasts to divide or differentiate. Muscle-specific ablation of Hh responsiveness will be required to test this hypothesis definitively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show that Hh can directly promote myoblast differentiation, at least in vitro. In vivo in chick limb bud, Hh signalling is occurring at the right time and place to affect early slow myogenesis. We introduce a new methodology, Cellagen implants of hybridoma cells secreting functionally-blocking antibody, and show that Hh is required for proper early slow (but not fast) muscle differentiation. Conversely, Hh over-expression induces ectopic early slow muscle in chick limb bud. Neither gain nor loss of later Hh function affects differentiation of later-formed slow muscle. Thus early limb Hh levels promote slow myogenesis, but are unlikely to be solely responsible for the details of slow fibre pattern. The data suggest a simple model of how direct and indirect effects of Hh sculpt early limb myogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Manipulated chick forelimbs</title><p>Chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were transfected with Shh/RCAS, a replication-competent retrovirus containing the entire <italic>cShh </italic>coding sequence.

All were maintained on plastic by standard procedures prior to plating on collagen-coated glass chamber slides (16-well, LAB-TEK, Nalge Nunc International, USA) in DMEM 10% FBS, 2% chick serum with antibiotics and differentiated by switching to DMEM 2% HS. Conditioned medium was created by incubating QT6 or ShhQT6 cells for 36 hours with either growth or differentiation medium. Each QT6 cell culture was used to condition only a single batch of medium. Purified Shh was synthesised in vitro and the biologically active proportion of the protein in each preparation is unknown, low and varies between batches (P. Ingham and T.
