One such element is the <italic>Sleeping Beauty </italic>(SB) transposon that has been shown in several studies to be an effective insertional mutagen in the mouse germline. SB transposon vector studies have employed different functional elements and reporter molecules to disrupt and report the expression of endogenous mouse genes. We sought to generate a transposon system that would be capable of reporting the expression pattern of a mouse gene while allowing for conditional expression of a gene of interest in a tissue- or temporal-specific pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report the systematic development and testing of a transposon-based gene-trap system incorporating the doxycycline-repressible Tet-Off (tTA) system that is capable of activating the expression of genes under control of a Tet response element (TRE) promoter. We demonstrate that the gene trap system is fully functional <italic>in vitro </italic>by introducing the "gene-trap tTA" vector into human cells by transposition and identifying clones that activate expression of a TRE-luciferase transgene in a doxycycline-dependent manner. In transgenic mice, we mobilize gene-trap tTA vectors, discover parameters that can affect germline mobilization rates, and identify candidate gene insertions to demonstrate the <italic>in vivo </italic>functionality of the vector system. We further demonstrate that the gene-trap can act as a reporter of endogenous gene expression and it can be coupled with bioluminescent imaging to identify genes with tissue-specific expression patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Akin to the GAL4/UAS system used in the fly, we have made progress developing a tool for mutating and revealing the expression of mouse genes by generating the tTA transactivator in the presence of a secondary TRE-regulated reporter molecule. A vector like the gene-trap tTA could provide a means for both annotating mouse genes and creating a resource of mice that express a regulable transcription factor in temporally- and tissue-specific patterns for conditional gene expression studies. These mice would be a valuable resource to the mouse genetics community for purpose of dissecting mammalian gene function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Derived from ancient salmonid fish sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the <italic>Sleeping Beauty </italic>(SB) transposon is a member of the Tc1/<italic>mariner </italic>superfamily of cut-and-paste transposable elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and has been developed as a vertebrate transformation tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and germline insertional mutagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We and others have shown that the SB transposon is highly active in the mouse germline and can generate heritable loss-of-function mutations that lead to detectable phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Data accumulated from spontaneous and engineered mouse mutations suggests that a significant percentage of mouse genes are essential for early development. This has necessitated the creation of various genetic tools for conditional loss- or gain-of-function genetic studies. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ability to regulate genes in a tissue- or temporally-specific manner has become one method to study the function of these genes. Likewise, the ability to control the expression of an essential mouse gene is one way to discover its function in tissues that are formed after lethal phenotypes are manifest. Temporal and spatial control of gene expression in mutant backgrounds can be used to determine when a gene product is required during a developmental process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. With this in mind, and taking lessons from the <italic>Drosophila </italic>literature on GAL4/UAS-based <italic>P</italic>-element transposon systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we designed a SB transposon-based gene trap system that allows us to annotate the expression pattern and function of mouse genes.</p><p>Previous studies using the SB transposon system for generating insertional mutations in the germline of mice used various gene- and polyA-trap transposon vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These vectors were designed to truncate an endogenous mRNA, incorporate coding sequences for a visible reporter like <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-Galactosidase or green fluorescent protein (GFP), and report the expression patterns of trapped genes. If a transcriptional transactivator, similar to GAL4, were used in place of a visible reporter molecule, a small amount of the molecule could lead to high levels of a secondary reporter transgene under control of a responsive promoter. Analogous to the GAL4/UAS system, the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and Tet-response element promoter (TRE) were developed for mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the creation of a mutagenic SB-based, gene-trap transposon vector that can insert into a mouse gene and express the Tet-off transcriptional transactivator (tTA) in its tissue- and temporally-regulated manner. The "gene-trap tTA" can mutate genes and record their expression patterns for functional annotation as well as create a mechanism for driving the expression of transgenes in a regulable manner <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also report several general parameters that impact the application of the <italic>Sleeping Beauty </italic>transposon system to mouse functional genomics including analysis of transposon mobilization rates in several different transgenic lines and the rescue of a mutant phenotype by remobilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Creation of the gene-trap tTA system</title><p>A SB transposon-based gene-trap tTA vector was first designed for and tested in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The gene-trap tTA vector was shown function in somatic tissues of zebrafish and activate a TRE-regulated GFP transgene. T2/GT2/tTA and T2/GT3/tTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) are similar to the earlier gene-trap tTA (GT/tTA) and encode a carp &#x003b2;-actin splice acceptor, the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), the Tet-Off<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(tTA) coding sequence (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and the SV40 late polyadenylation signal. Modifications are described in the Materials and Methods and include an upgrade to the 'T2' versions of the SB inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITR), demonstrated to increase transposition activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the addition of stop codon sequences in each reading frame just upstream of the IRES. The T2/GT3/tTA transposon vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) was additionally modified to include a splice acceptor from the mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRT) and a V5-epitope tag on the opposite strand of the transposon. This allows the gene trap to disrupt gene expression upon insertion into a mouse gene in either orientation. If open reading frame one were conserved after splicing from the endogenous exon, the V5-epitope would be added to the truncated peptide.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows the method by which the gene-trap tTA can disrupt a mouse gene. When the gene-trap transposon lands in the intron of a gene, it will intercept splicing from an upstream exon and incorporate the IRES and tTA elements to form a bicistronic messenger RNA. Translation of the endogenous gene peptide is truncated at one of the stop codons incorporated just upstream of the IRES. The IRES element allows cap-independent translation initiation from the second open reading frame to produce tTA from the same mRNA. For the T2/GT2/tTA vector, an insertion into a gene in the opposite orientation is not predicted to mutate the gene, however, the T2/GT3/tTA would interrupt splicing with the HPRT splice acceptor, but will not express tTA.</p><p>Before making transgenic mice, we validated the functionality of the gene-trap tTA as a faithful activator of reporter gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, a G418-resistance cassette was cloned into the T2/GT2/tTA transposon vector to generate T2/GT2/tTA/SVNeo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We then generated a HeLa cell line harboring a TRE-regulated luciferase transgene. Upon co-transfection of the pT2/GT2/tTA/SVNeo transposon vector plasmid and a source of SB transposase, pCMV-SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the gene-trap tTA transposes at random into the HeLa cell genome. The SVNeo cassette confers G418 resistance to cells that integrate and express the transposon vector, but the gene-trap tTA cassette can intercept splicing and express tTA only if the transposon lands in an expressed gene in the correct orientation. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> shows the luciferase activation in sixty-two individual G418-resistant clone extracts. As a control, a transposon that contained the same G418 resistance cassette, but not the splice acceptor-IRES-tTA cassette, did not activate luciferase expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, white bars). As expected, only a subset of T2/GT2/tTA/SVNeo-transgenic clones, 17 out of 50, showed activation of TRE-luciferase above background levels.</p><p>The activity of tTA is regulable by administering the drug tetracycline or its analog doxycycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We tested this sensitivity by administering doxycycline to three of the TRE-luciferase activated clones from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> shows the doxycycline-dependent repression of TRE-luciferase activation in each clone. Luciferase activity was reduced approximately two orders of magnitude in clones, 43 and 44, and about one order of magnitude in clone 39. Finally, to assure that gene trap tTA activation was dependent on splicing from an upstream exon of an expressed gene, 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with primers specific to the gene trap on mRNA extracts prepared from several clones. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> shows the sequence tags, chromosomes and gene identification obtained for seven clones. In each case, an upstream exon of the gene is spliced into the gene-trap tTA at the predicted position (underlined). These data demonstrate that the tTA molecule can be expressed from the gene-trap tTA vector in the context of a trapped gene to activate a TRE-regulated transgene and that this activation is repressible by the addition of doxycycline. With the prospect of generating mouse strains with regulated gene-trap tTA activation, we set out to test the system <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Parameters affecting germline mobilization rates</title><p>Transgenic mice were generated with the T2/GT2/tTA and T2/GT3/tTA transposon vectors by standard pronuclear injection (see Materials and Methods). A typical result of this protocol is the head-to-tail concatenation of transgene units before integrating into the mouse genome to create a multi-copy array of transgenes in a mouse chromosome. Each transposon transgene concatemer, thus, serves as a donor site containing multiple substrates for mobilization by the SB transposase. To determine the number of gene-trap tTA transposons in each transgenic line, we performed Southern blot analysis using a restriction digest scheme that resolves the concatemerized transposons to a single band and estimated the number of copies based on its intensity (see Materials and Methods). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows ten independent transgenic founder lines with transposon copy numbers ranging from approximately three to sixty copies. To test for mobilization of the transposons in the germline, each transgenic line was crossed to the CAGGS-SB10 transposase-expressing strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The resulting doubly transgenic "seed" mice were outcrossed to wild type animals to observe gene trap mobilization in the germline. Southern blot analysis on tail biopsy DNA from offspring of seed mice was used, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], to observe the number of new transposon insertions per gamete. We averaged the insertion data from seed mice from each line to calculate the likelihood (rate per copy number) that a transposon could be mobilized from their respective concatemers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The data demonstrates that lines with fewer copies of the transposon substrate show the lowest mobilization rates. This, however, is not a strict correlation. This is evident in comparing lines 6632 and 6657, where the former has fewer copies, but shows a higher per-copy-transposon mobilization rate of the latter.</p><p>The inability to mobilize transposons in transgenic mice with few transposons in the concatemer is consistent with our efforts to re-mobilize a single copy insertion in the genome. We analyzed the mobilization of two independently generated single copy insertions. Insertion 01-0032 was generated and described in an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and 02A-0016 is a gene-trap tTA insertion identified in an offspring of a T2/GT2/tTA seed male (line 4583) as described below. When SB transposons are excised from a chromosome locus during gametogenesis, host DNA repair machinery typically creates a "footprint" of a few or several base pairs while repairing the double-strand-break gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We mobilized the insertions 01-0032 and 02A-0016 by intercrossing doubly transgenic mice that harbor a single-copy transposon insertion and the CAGGS-SB10 transposase transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We detected transposition in about one out of every 100 offspring for either insertion by PCR amplifying the sequences that flank the donor site and sequencing to detect a footprint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Notably, remobilization of insertion 01-0032, which causes an early recessive embryonic lethal phenotype as a result of disruption of the mouse <italic>Slc25a22 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], restores activity of the gene and rescues the recessive lethality associated with this insertion as heterozygous 01-0032/footprint mice are phenotypically normal mice. The inability to efficiently remobilize a single copy insertion has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For this reason, we incorporated loxP sites into the T2/GT3/tTA vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), flanking the mutagenic portion of the gene-trap vector. Cre-mediated recombination in tissues and in the germline have been demonstrated and are significantly higher than the 1% mobilization rate we can achieve by remobilizing single copy insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, a T2/GT3/tTA gene trap disruption of a mouse gene might be rescued by expression of Cre recombinase in a tissue- or germline-specific manner.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> also demonstrates that germline mobilization rates are lower in the female germline when compared to their male siblings (dashed boxes). Finally, the solid box shows the difference in transposition rates between two sibling male seed mice, one hemizygous and one homozygous for the transposase transgene. While the SB10+/+ seed male did not show increased transposition over other independently generated seed mice for the 4563 line, there was an increase over its sibling SB10+/- seed male, suggesting that we may be able to increase transposition rates by increasing the transposase dosage in future studies. The analysis of several transposon-transgenic lines has thus revealed parameters that affect transposition rates, and suggest careful line selection will be required for mutagenic programs.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sleeping Beauty</italic>-mediated gene insertion <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>T2/GT2/tTA line 4563 and T2/GT3/tTA line 6660 were useful to identify new transposon insertions in the offspring of seed mice. Techniques for cloning transposon-genomic DNA junction sequences have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The chromosomal positions of thirty transposition events in offspring of seed mice from line 4563 were identified by querying the ENSEMBL online mouse genome database using the BLAST function. The T2/GT3/tTA line 6660 was used in a study of mutations induced specifically on mouse chromosome 11 and the insertion data from this line will be reported elsewhere (A.M.G., manuscript in preparation). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">additional file 3</xref> show the data accumulated from the thirty T2/GT2/tTA events. Consistent with previous reports, the T2/GT2/tTA transposons exhibit local hopping, where a significant percentage of new insertions cluster in a particular region of the genome, and the insertions can land in genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Three-primer PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] can readily be used to genotype carriers for any specific transposon insertion. Because we were interested in testing the function of the gene-trap tTA vector in the context of an endogenous mouse gene, carriers of insertions 02A-0001 and 02A-0002, both in mouse genes, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) were propagated for further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular characterization of gene-trap tTA function</title><p>Insertion number 02A-0001 is in the first intron of the carbonic anhydrase-12 gene (<italic>Car12</italic>), while 02A-0002 is inserted into intron 8 of the predicted novel gene <italic>ENSMUSG00000066992 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The top panel in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> shows the expression pattern of mouse <italic>Car12 </italic>by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on RNA extracts from several wild type tissues using primers in exons 1 and 5. If the gene trap is splicing properly, the IRES and tTA sequences should be fused to exon 1 of the <italic>Car12 </italic>mRNA. The second panel shows RT-PCR detection of endogenous <italic>Car12 </italic>and <italic>Car12</italic>-IRES-tTA bicistronic transcripts in RNA samples taken from a heterozygous carrier of insertion 02A-0001. Nested PCR was necessary to detect the fusion transcript in some tissues. Comparing the wild type expression pattern of <italic>Car12 </italic>mRNA and the fusion transcript, it is apparent that expression of the trapped mRNA is tissue specific as predicted. The fusion transcript can be detected in the heart of the carrier, but not wildtype heart RNA extracts. We attribute this to the extra sensitivity of the nested PCR and suspect that endogenous <italic>Car12 </italic>is expressed in the heart at a low level.</p><p>If the carp &#x003b2;-actin splice acceptor is efficient, it should truncate the endogenous gene mRNA after the nearest upstream exon. Total RNA extracts from wild type, and heterozygous or homozygous carriers of both insertions 02A-0001 and 02A-0002 were probed for expression of endogenous Car12 or ENSMUSG00000066992 transcripts respectively. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> shows complete ablation of Car12 mRNA in the kidney and brain of a homozygous carrier of insertion 02A-0001. Expression of ENSMUSG00000066992, detectable by RT-PCR exclusively in mouse brain (data not shown), was not ablated in homozygous carriers of insertion 02-0002, however, suggesting that the carp &#x003b2;-actin splice acceptor does not work efficiently in each case.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>Car12 </italic>mutant mice demonstrate reduced fitness, as an intercross of 02A-0001 carriers results in non-mendelian inheritance of the homozygous class (data not shown). The expression of the carbonic anhydrase (CA-XII) has been previously localized to the membranes of mouse kidney, colon, and testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The CA-XII peptide has been previously reported to be 46 kDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> shows the reduction of CA-XII expression in the heterozygous kidney and absence in the homozygous kidney. Antibody cross-reaction with a ~ 30-kDa peptide is consistent with cross-reactions previously seen in kidney extracts with this antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and serves as a loading control (arrowhead, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific activation of a TRE promoter-regulated transgene <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The final <italic>in vivo </italic>test for the gene-trap tTA system is to determine whether the vectors can activate a TRE promoter-regulated transgene in a tissue-specific manner. We obtained the Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J strain of mice, transgenic for a TRE-regulated luciferase transgene, from Jackson Laboratories. These mice have been previously shown to respond to tissue-specific tTA expression in a doxycycline-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Luciferase activity assays from individual organ extracts from a 02A-0001; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J doubly transgenic animals showed activation of luciferase in all tissues tested when compared to singly transgenic controls (data not shown). This result was surprising because the trapped gene, <italic>Car12</italic>, is not expressed in the liver (among other tissues) by RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Insertion 02A-0001 is the result of local transposition, and thus is linked to the original concatemer of transposons. We reasoned that these linked T2/GT2/tTA transgenes present in carriers of this insertion might express tTA, therefore resulting ubiquitous luciferase expression when crossed to the Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J strain. To circumvent this issue, we focused on insertions that were not the result of local hopping and would segregate from other transposable elements. Insertions 02A-0002, 03A-0184, 03A-0217, and 03A-0241 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) are the result of non-local transposition of T2/GT2/tTA or T2/GT3/tTA transposons in their respective transposon transgenic strains. Carriers of each of these gene insertions were crossed to the Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J strain of mice with the hope of visualizing tissue-specific, tTA-dependent transactivation of luciferase. As predicted, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows weak activation of luciferase in the brain of a 02A-0002; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J doubly transgenic mice, but not other tissues. This pattern was reproduced in three out of four mice. As shown above, this insertion does not completely disrupt the brain expression of <italic>ENSMUSG00000066992 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), but some splicing into the T2/GT2/tTA splice acceptor must occur to allow tissue-specific expression of the tTA.</p><p>Hasan, et al. (2001) demonstrated that non-invasive imaging of luciferase expression of a similar tTA-activated strain using an intensified charge-coupled device camera system after subcutaneous injection of luciferin substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We used the Xenogen IVIS&#x02122;100 Imaging System to see if tissue-specific patterns could be detected in gene-trap tTA; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J doubly transgenic mice. Light emissions are often observed in the extremities, nose, ears, and tails of control Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J in a tTA-independent manner in our hands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). No additional tissue-specific signals were initially detected in 02A-0001; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J or 02A-0002; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J doubly transgenic mice, suggesting that expression of luciferase levels detected in the organ extracts were not sufficient to be detected by the imager. Likewise, when crossed to the Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J strain, insertions 03A-0184 and 03A-0217 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) showed no activation of luciferase by imaging or by luminometer readings of organ extracts (data not shown). While the expression pattern of Membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 6C (<italic>Ms4a6c</italic>) is not characterized, Integrin beta 3 (<italic>Itgb3</italic>) has been localized to the developing mouse heart in early embryonic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is possible that we missed the expression of these gene-trap tTA insertions because these genes are not expressed in adult tissues.</p><p>In contrast, a striking pattern of luciferase expression was captured by imaging 03A-0241; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J doubly transgenic mice (mouse 936) when compared to singly 03A-0241 transgenic (mouse 933) or Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Light emission patterns were detected from anatomical origins corresponding to the sternum, spleen, femurs and vertebrae, presumably reflecting luciferase activation in a component of the bone marrow and hematopoietic cells. The <italic>MacF1 </italic>gene has more than 100 exons and has been reported to be expressed in multiple isoforms in the mouse with high levels produced in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Using primers in exons that flank the 03A-0241 insertion to amplify <italic>MacF1 </italic>transcripts, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> demonstrates that at least two splice variants of different sizes are variably expressed in several tissues, but <italic>MacF1 </italic>is not normally expressed in the bone marrow of a wild-type mouse. This suggests that the 03A-0241 insertion into <italic>MacF1 </italic>may cause abnormal expression of the gene in the bone marrow and hematopoietic cells. However, multiple attempts to amplify the chimeric <italic>MacF1</italic>-IRES-tTA transcript from bone marrow extracts from carrier mice by RT-PCR were unsuccessful in identifying this spliced transcript.</p><p>To determine whether this pattern was linked only to insertion 03A-0241 and the mouse <italic>MacF1 </italic>gene, Southern blots and genotyping PCR were performed on mouse 936 (and siblings 931&#x02013;935) and his offspring (mice 949&#x02013;976) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Surprisingly, mice that inherited insertion 03A-0241 by PCR showed linkage to the concatemer donor site by Southern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, arrowhead). This was unexpected because these mice were generated from T2/GT3/tTA line 6660 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which has a transposon donor site on mouse chromosome 11. <italic>MacF1 </italic>is located on mouse chromosome 4 at 57.4 cM, thus the Southern data suggests that a large portion of the chromosome-11 concatemer had translocated by some mechanism to chromosome-4. Thus, the <italic>MacF1 </italic>insertion on chromosome 4 is still genetically linked to a translocated donor concatemer of multiple T2/GT3/tTA transposons in addition to other linked single-copy insertions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, arrows). Repeated attempts to identify these other linked chromosome-4 insertions by our cloning techniques and 5'RACE for trapped sequences in bone marrow extracts were unsuccessful in identifying the origin of this tissue-specific gene-trap tTA expression. Nevertheless, the pattern seen in 03A-0241; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J mice is unique to these mice, as it is not seen in carriers of other T2/GT2/tTA or T2/GT3/tTA insertions (with or without associated concatemers) when crossed to the Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J strain (above and data not shown).</p><p>The tissue-specific luciferase pattern in carriers of this insertion could be reproducibly transmitted through the germline to offspring (mice 962&#x02013;964 and 971&#x02013;973, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). The upper range of luciferase activation from each offsrpring, measured in photons/second/cm<sup>2</sup>, ranged approximately a thousand-fold (scale bars). We attribute these differences to differences in the levels of cap-independent translation of the tTA molecule from the IRES in each mouse. Finally, other groups have demonstrated <italic>in vivo </italic>sensitivity of tTA-dependent activation of gene expression to tetracycline, or its analog doxycycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We determined whether we could control gene-trap tTA activation of luciferase by administering doxycycline to the drinking water of the 03A-0241; Tg(tetL)1Bjd/J mice. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> demonstrates absence of luciferase signal in the same animals from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, after six days of treatment, suggesting complete repression of the tTA-dependent luciferase activation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined the utility of a SB transposon-base gene trap vector that expresses the Tet-off transcriptional transactivator in the patterns of trapped genes <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The gene-trap tTA demonstrated full utility in cultured cells, having the ability to insert in genes, trap the splicing of those genes to express the tTA transcription factor which, in turn, could activate a TRE-regulated transgene in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Likewise, analysis of gene-trap tTA transposon insertions into mouse genes revealed that the vector system can completely disrupt the expression of a mouse gene in some cases and can tissue-specifically activate expression of a TRE promoter-regulated transgene in a doxycycline-dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic>. While ultimately this vector system can function as designed, several observations suggest we need a more optimal approach for creating a resource of mice that express tTA in developmentally-controlled patterns.</p><p>Germline SB transposon mobilization rates in the mouse germline are variable and ranged from less than one in twenty to nearly three events per gamete. An evaluation of several different transposon-transgenic lines has given us insight into the potential the SB system to perform regional mutagenesis throughout the genome. The genomic location of the transposon donor site, along with copy number, impacts the germline mobilization rate from any concatemer (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This suggests that not all parts of the genome are equally accessible to SB transposition. Understanding the mechanisms behind this "mobilization position effect" will likely require an increased understanding about molecular regulators of <italic>SB </italic>transposition, but may include a well known director of position effect, heterochromatinization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>As demonstrated in previous studies and here, <italic>SB </italic>transposon-based gene trap vectors can function <italic>in vivo </italic>to disrupt the expression of mouse genes. The T2/GT2/tTA vector can completely ablate the expression of a mouse gene as demonstrated by the null mutation that was generated in the mouse <italic>Car12 </italic>gene. Not all gene insertions completely disrupt gene expression however, as in the case of insertion 02A-0002 into <italic>ENSMUSG00000066992</italic>. While hypomorphic mutations may be valuable to discover the function of an essential mouse gene, this has lead to ideas on how to improve the efficacy of future vectors. Splice acceptors derived from different genes, termination sequences (polyadenylation signals) and other functional sequences have been used in several ES cell plasmid- and retroviral-based gene-trapping studies with varying efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Drawing data from other groups will lead to improved vectors for trapping mouse genes and perhaps lead to vectors to trap certain classes of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The activation of luciferase by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator varied rougly 1000-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) when expressed from the IRES in the gene-trap tTA. Once again, improvements to the functional components of the gene trap vector may lead to more reliable and greater expression of the transactivator. Alternative IRES elements like the 9-nucleotide IRES element from the murine <italic>Gtx </italic>homeodomain gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], or eliminating the IRES entirely, may allow for more consistent tTA expression.</p><p>The brilliant pattern of <italic>in vivo </italic>luciferase expression seen if Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> was initially thought to originate from insertion in the <italic>MacF1 </italic>gene. Published reports suggested that neither the bone marrow, nor hematopoietic cells are in the normal expression domain of this gene. Upon further molecular characterization, we discovered that this gene was not spliced into the gene-trap tTA, and by Southern blot, found it was tightly linked to other insertions as well as the concatemer. It seems more likely that the pattern of tTA-dependent luciferase activation seen in carriers of the 03A-0241 insertion comes from one of these linked transposons. Efforts to find the source of this expression by 5'RACE were unfortunately unsuccessful. We propose that in the case of insertion 03A-0241, the concatemer translocated to chromosome 4 first, then a single copy of T2/GT3/tTA hopped locally into <italic>MacF1</italic>. We have observed similar and other types of genomic rearrangements associated with transposition from the chromosome-11 donor site in other mice (A.M.G., manuscript in preparation). These observations would suggest that gene-trap tTA mobilization in the germline may not be the most efficient means of generating a resource of mice with tissue-specific tTA expression patterns. It is not clear, however, that these large donor site insertions are not rare events that could be tolerated. Independent insertions, unlinked to the concatemer or other transposons, are frequently recovered. By pre-selecting mice that do not inherit the concatemer by Southern blot or PCR analysis, a screen would largely avoid the complications of linked transposons.</p><p>An alternative and relatively facile approach would be to inject a linearized plasmid harboring the gene-trap tTA transposon, along with <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed transposase messenger RNA, into one-cell mouse embryos. In the one-cell embryo, the transposase mRNA is translated and transposase catalyzes integration into the mouse genome at rates that are two to three-fold higher than standard pronuclear injection of naked DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This method produces transgenic mice with insertions distributed randomly across the genome, and multiple linkage groups are frequently obtained from a single injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This would be another method to avoid the complications of linked insertions and concatemers.</p><p>Finally, using the <italic>GAL4</italic>/UAS enhancer trap systems used in the fly, expression-based screening has been useful for identifying genes with similar or overlapping expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and for tissue-specific overexpression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As we have shown here, a transgenic mouse expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the tet-response enhancer/promoter (TRE) can be coupled with the gene-trap tTA system to identify <italic>in vivo </italic>patterns with an intensified CCD camera system. In a screen, this type of imaging could be used to identify gene trap insertions that lead to tTA expression in a particular tissue or developmental stage, even <italic>in utero </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Alternatively, mouse strains for other TRE-regulated transgenes have been created, allowing for tTA-dependent expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] or GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. If the efficiency of the gene-trap tTA transposon can be improved, these strains could be used by any lab to identify tissue-specific patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>As a tool for the mouse community, introducing a gene-trap tTA vector into mouse genes with different spatial and temporal expression patterns would create a valuable tool for the mouse genetic toolbox. Tissue-specific promoters can control the expression of transactivators like tTA and rtTA (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator) in transgenic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Having tissue-specific and temporal control of gene expression in any mouse tissue at any developmental stage could allow for the dissection of biological gene functions that were previously masked by a phenotype such as lethality. An SB-based transposon vector is well suited to accomplish this task by introducing precisely integrated functional reporter units into the mouse genome. In addition, an improved gene-trap tTA could provide more reliable expression of the transactivator than a transgene construct since transcription is regulated in the context of an endogenous gene and is thus less likely to be subject to the position effect variegation that can hinder the expression of transgenes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning gene-trap tTA transposon vectors</title><p>All primer/oligo sequences for PCR and cloning are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>.

An artificial exon (based on carp &#x003b2;-actin exon 2), with stop codons in each reading frame, was created by annealing four oligos (AMG049-AMG052), filling in the gaps with Klenow DNA polymerase, ligation with T4 DNA ligase, PCR amplifying with AMG049 and AMG051, and subcloning the <italic>Age</italic>I fragment into the partially-digested <italic>Sma</italic>I-<italic>Age</italic>I fragment of pGT/tTA to create pGT2/tTA.
