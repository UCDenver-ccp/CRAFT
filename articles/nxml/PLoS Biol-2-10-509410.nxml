They display marked differences in respect to contraction, metabolism, and susceptibility to fatigue. Type I fibers are mitochondria-rich and mainly use oxidative metabolism for energy production, which provides a stable and long-lasting supply of ATP, and thus are fatigue-resistant. Type II fibers comprise three subtypes, IIa, IIx, and IIb. Type IIb fibers have the lowest levels of mitochondrial content and oxidative enzymes, rely on glycolytic metabolism as a major energy source, and are susceptible to fatigue, while the oxidative and contraction functions of type IIa and IIx lie between type I and IIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Booth1">Booth and Thomason 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Berchtold1">Berchtold et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Olson1">Olson and Williams 2000</xref>). Adult skeletal muscle shows plasticity and can undergo conversion between different fiber types in response to exercise training or modulation of motoneuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Booth1">Booth and Thomason 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Jarvis1">Jarvis et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Pette1">Pette 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Olson1">Olson and Williams 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Hood1">Hood 2001</xref>). This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a calcium signaling pathway that involves calcineurin, calmodulin-dependent kinase, and the transcriptional cofactor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Naya1">Naya et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Olson1">Olson and Williams 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lin1">Lin et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wu1">Wu et al. 2002</xref>). However, the targeted transcriptional factors directly responsible for reprogramming the fiber-specific contractile and metabolic genes remain to be identified.</p><p>Muscle fiber specification appears to be associated with obesity and diabetes. For instance, rodents that gain the most weight on high-fat diets possess fewer type I fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Abou1">Abou et al. 1992</xref>). In obese patients, skeletal muscle has been observed to have reduced oxidative capacity, increased glycolytic capacity, and a decreased percentage of type I fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Hickey1">Hickey et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Tanner1">Tanner et al. 2002</xref>). Similar observations have been made in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lillioja1">Lillioja et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Hickey1">Hickey et al. 1995</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that increasing oxidative fibers can lead to improved insulin action and reduced adipocyte size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Luquet1">Luquet et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Ryder1">Ryder et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>We have previously established that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b4; is a major transcriptional regulator of fat burning in adipose tissue through activation of enzymes associated with long-chain fatty-acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wang1">Wang et al. 2003</xref>). Although PPAR&#x003b4; is the predominant PPAR isoform present in skeletal muscle, its in vivo function has not been determined. Our current study uncovers PPAR&#x003b4; as the first transcription factor able to drive the formation of functional type I muscle fibers, whose activation entrains complex pathways both enhancing physical performance and creating a state of obesity resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Activation of PPAR&#x003b4; Leads to Muscle Fiber Transformation</title><p>A role of PPAR&#x003b4; in muscle fiber was suggested by its enhanced expression&#x02014;at levels 10-fold and 50-fold greater than PPAR&#x003b1; and &#x003b3; isoforms, respectively (unpublished data). An examination of PPAR&#x003b4; in different muscle fibers reveals a significantly higher level in type I muscle (soleus) relative to type II&#x02013;rich muscle (extensor digitorum longus) or type I and type II mixed muscle (gastrocnemius) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">Figure 1</xref>A); this expression pattern closely resembles that of PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lin1">Lin et al. 2002</xref>). A similar pattern but with more pronounced differences was found at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>To directly assess the role of activation of PPAR&#x003b4; in control of muscle fiber plasticity and mitochondrial biogenesis, we generated mice expressing a transgene in which the 78-amino-acid VP16 activation domain was fused to the N-terminus of full-length PPAR&#x003b4;, under control of the 2.2-kb human &#x003b1;-skeletal actin promoter. In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Brennan1">Brennan and Hardeman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Clapham1">Clapham et al. 2000</xref>), the VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; transgene was selectively expressed in skeletal muscle, with 10-fold less in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Among different types of muscle fibers, the levels of VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; expression appeared to be similar (unpublished data). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">Figure 1</xref>D for gastrocnemius muscle, VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; fusion protein was produced at a level similar to that of endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; in wild-type littermates. Interestingly, the level of endogenous muscle PPAR&#x003b4; protein in the transgenic mice was much higher than in the control littermates. The substantial increase of endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; may have been caused by a switch to type I fiber (see below), which intrinsically expresses higher levels of PPAR&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g001">1</xref>B).</p><p>Type I muscle can be readily distinguished from type II or mixed muscle by its red color, because of its high concentration of myoglobin, a protein typically expressed in oxidative muscle fibers. We found that muscles in the transgenic mice appeared redder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), which is particularly evident in the mixed type I/II fibers of the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Indeed, metachromatic staining revealed a substantial muscle fiber transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In gastrocnemius muscle, we estimated that there was a 2-fold increase of type I fibers. A diagnostic component of oxidative fibers is their high myoglobin and mitochondrial content, which is supported by the mRNA analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>A. In addition to myoglobin, mitochondrial components for electron transfer (cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase &#x0005b;COX&#x0005d; II and IV) and fatty-acid &#x003b2;-oxidation enzymes were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; unpublished data). These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR&#x003b4; activation, as levels of PGC-1&#x003b1;, a coactivator involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wu2">Wu et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lehman1">Lehman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lin1">Lin et al. 2002</xref>), remained unchanged. Southern blot analysis detected a substantially higher copy number of the mitochondrial genome&#x02013;encoded COXII DNA in the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Mitochondrial DNA was increased 2.3-fold in gastrocnemius muscle of the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). These results reveal a marked stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and further support the idea that there is a muscle fiber switch. This conclusion was also confirmed by Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, the characteristic type I fiber proteins, such as myoglobin and cytochrome c and b, were significantly increased. More importantly, the specialized contraction protein troponin I (slow) of type I fiber was robustly induced; this was accompanied by a marked reduction of the specialized contraction protein troponin I (fast) of type II fiber, indicating a high degree of fiber transformation. We next examined whether acute activation of endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; would induce similar target genes. In agreement with the chronic effects in the transgenic mice, we found that, after treatment of wild-type C57B6J mice with the PPAR&#x003b4;-specific agonist GW501516 for only 10 d, genes for slow fiber contractile proteins, mitochondrial biogenesis, and &#x003b2;-oxidation were all upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). This indicates that rapid, systematic, and coordinated changes of muscle fiber properties toward type I can be achieved by activation of the endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Muscle Fiber Switch by PPAR&#x003b4; Protects Against Obesity</title><p>A number of previous studies have shown that obese individuals have fewer oxidative fibers, implying that the presence of oxidative fibers alone may play a part in obesity resistance. To test this possibility, we fed the transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates with a high-fat diet for 97 d. Although the initial body weights of the two groups were very similar, the transgenic mice had gained less than 50&#x00025; at day 47, and only one-third at day 97, of the weight gained by the wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The transgenic mice displayed significantly higher oxygen consumption on the high-fat diet than the control littermates (unpublished data). By the end of this experiment, the control littermates became obese, whereas the transgenic mice still maintained a normal body weight and fat mass composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). A histological analysis of inguinal fat pad revealed a much smaller cell size in the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), due to the increased muscle oxidative capacity. While there was no significant difference in intramuscular glycogen content, the triglyceride content was much less in the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">4</xref>D), which may explain their improved glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). We also placed wild-type C57BJ6 mice on the high-fat diet and treated them with either vehicle or the PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW501516 for 2 mo. GW501516 produced a sustained induction of genes for type I muscle fibers; this, at least in part, resulted in an only 30&#x00025; gain in body weight, a dramatically reduced fat mass accumulation, and improved glucose tolerance, compared to the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, muscle fiber conversion by stimulation with the PPAR&#x003b4; agonist or the activated transgene has a protective role against obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Activation of PPAR&#x003b4; Enhances Physical Performance</title><p>Muscle oxidative capacity is a crucial factor for determining endurance and fatigue. Indeed, type I fibers adaptively generated through exercise training are considered to be fatigue resistant. However, whether the type I fibers generated molecularly via PPAR&#x003b4; expression can contribute to enhanced performance in the absence of previous training is unclear. In fact, the consequence of genetically induced fiber switch on running capacity has to our knowledge never been evaluated. We thus compared exercise performance between untrained, body-weight-matched transgenic and wild-type littermates. Mice were run on oxygen-infused, enclosed treadmills until exhaustion. Strikingly, the running time and distance the transgenic mice were able to sustain were increased by 67&#x00025; and 92&#x00025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g006">Figure 6</xref>A; also see Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref>). The transgenic mice ran about 1 h longer than the controls, which translates to nearly a kilometer further. No significant differences in muscle mass (unpublished data) and daily activity (total counts of activity per hour: 1618 &#x000b1; 209 for transgenic versus 1987 &#x000b1; 301 for wild-type, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.35, <italic>n</italic> = 4) were observed between the transgenic and control mice. Thus, the remarkable increase in endurance is the physiologic manifestation of muscle fiber transformation. This suggests that genetically directed muscle fiber switch is physiologically and functionally relevant. In addition, we looked at what effect the absence of PPAR&#x003b4; function has on exercise endurance. In the treadmill test, the PPAR&#x003b4;-null mice could sustain only 38&#x00025; of the running time and 34&#x00025; of the distance of their age- and weight-matched wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). These results further support a role for PPAR&#x003b4; in enhancement of physical performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data reveal that a PPAR&#x003b4;-mediated transcriptional pathway can regulate muscle fiber specification, enabling the generation of a strain of mice with a &#x0201c;long-distance running&#x0201d; phenotype. We show that targeted expression of an activated form of PPAR&#x003b4; produces profound and coordinated increases in oxidation enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis, and production of specialized type I fiber contractile proteins&#x02014;the three hallmarks for muscle fiber type switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). While induction of muscle oxidation enzymes by PPAR&#x003b4; has been seen both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Muoio1">Muoio et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Dressel1">Dressel et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Luquet1">Luquet et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Tanaka1">Tanaka et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wang1">Wang et al. 2003</xref>), its effects shown here on muscle fiber switching are unexpected. These progressive changes in oxidative capacity in conjunction with eventual changes in type I muscle fiber lead to a dramatically improved exercise profile and protection against obesity. This does not solely depend on achieving a directed muscle fiber type switch but also requires all the associated changes in neural innervation, motor neuron function, and peripheral metabolic adaptation to enable a new integrated physiological response. Accordingly, activation of muscle PPAR&#x003b4; essentially recapitulates the effects of exercise training even in the absence of training itself. To our knowledge, this has not been directly described for any other transcriptional factor.</p><p>The muscle phenotypes described here are remarkably similar to those of transgenic mice expressing either calcineurin, calmodulin-dependent kinase, or PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Naya1">Naya et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Lin1">Lin et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wu1">Wu et al. 2002</xref>), indicating that PPAR&#x003b4; could be one of the hypothetical downstream transcription factors of these pathways. It is important to note that, from our ligand and gain-of-function transgenic studies, PPAR&#x003b4; needs to be activated in order to direct the muscle fiber switch. Indeed, in a recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Luquet1">Luquet et al. (2003)</xref>, simple overexpression of wild-type PPAR&#x003b4; in muscle was found not to be sufficient to promote a fiber switch or obesity resistance, although certain oxidation enzymes were increased. This supports the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020294-g006">Figure 6</xref>C that the activating signal or ligand, but not the receptor, is limiting. Thus, PPAR&#x003b4; activation, rather than merely an increase of PPAR&#x003b4; levels, is an essential element for fiber switching and its associated functional manifestations. How might endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; become activated naturally by exercise training? First, it is possible that exercise generates or increases endogenous ligands for PPAR&#x003b4; as tissues are undergoing substantial increases in fatty-acid internalization and burning. Fatty acids and their metabolites can activate PPAR&#x003b4;. A second model is that exercise may induce expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Goto1">Goto et al. 2000</xref>) and thereby activate PPAR&#x003b4;. This is consistent with previous work in which we have shown that PGC-1&#x003b1; physically associates with PPAR&#x003b4; in muscle tissue and can powerfully activate it even in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Wang1">Wang et al. 2003</xref>). Alternatively, PPAR&#x003b4; may be activated by a distal upstream signaling component such as a kinase cascade. Further dissecting the interactions between PPAR&#x003b4; and its regulatory components will be necessary to fully understand the molecular basis of muscle fiber determination pertinent to exercise training.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is a major site to regulate whole-body fatty-acid and glucose metabolism. We show that mice with increased oxidative fibers are resistant to high-fat-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Moreover, ligand studies provide compelling evidence that activation of endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; can produce similar effects. Might PPAR&#x003b4; have any beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in the lean condition? This has not been explored; however, insulin resistance in the elderly is confined mostly to skeletal muscle and may be due to reduction of mitochondrial number and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Petersen1">Petersen et al. 2003</xref>). The ability of PPAR&#x003b4; to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function suggests that PPAR&#x003b4; could be important for control of insulin resistance during normal aging. Together, these data indicate that PPAR&#x003b4; and its ligands comprise a key molecular switch to regulate muscle fiber specification, obesity resistance, insulin sensitivity, and, most surprisingly, physical endurance. This work demonstrates that complex physiologic properties such as fatigue, endurance, and running capacity can be genetically manipulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Animals.</title><p>The transactivation domain (78 amino acid residues, corresponding to residues 413&#x02013;490) of VP16 was fused in frame with the N-terminus of mouse PPAR&#x003b4;.

PPAR&#x003b4;-null mice were previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020294-Barak1">Barak et al. 2002</xref>). Mice were fed either a standard chow with 4&#x00025; (w/w) fat content (Harlan Teklad, Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States) or a high-fat diet containing 35&#x00025; (w/w) fat content (product F3282, Bioserv, Frenchtown, New Jersey, United States) as indicated.
