This process is vital for the propagation of a species, and involves a large portion of the genome of an organism to ensure the quality and quantity of the final products. It is estimated that mutations in up to 11% of all genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> might lead to male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This is likely to be true for humans also, considering the extremely high incidence (4&#x02013;5%) of infertility in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among the genes associated with male infertility is the <italic>DAZ</italic> (Deleted in Azoospermia) gene family. The family includes the Y-linked <italic>DAZ</italic> genes that are present only in great apes and old world monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and the autosomal <italic>DAZL1</italic> (DAZ-like 1) and BOULE genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in all mammals. Deletion of the <italic>DAZ</italic> genes is found in about 10% of infertile males with idiopathic azoospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and disruption of <italic>Dazl1</italic> causes infertility in both male and female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>DAZ</italic> family members of <italic>Drosophila</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], <italic>C. elegans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and <italic>Xenopus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] also affect the fertility in either males, females, or both sexes.</p><p>The <italic>DAZ</italic> gene family encodes RNA binding proteins that are expressed specifically in germ cells. DAZ and DAZL are expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of primordial germ cells and spermatogonia, and in the cytoplasm of meiotic spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. BOULE is expressed later, in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Boule mutants was defective in the translation of the meiosis-specific CDC25 homologue, Twine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and DAZL was found to be associated with polyribosomes in mouse testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently, DAZL was shown both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a yeast three-hybrid system to bind specifically to oligo(U) stretches interspersed by G or C residues, including a U-rich segment in the 5' UTR of mouse <italic>Cdc25C</italic> mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to elucidate the function of the <italic>DAZ gene</italic> family and to understanding the mechanisms of its action, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to isolate two human genes encoding DAZ associated proteins (DAZAPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One of them, <italic>DAZAP1,</italic> is expressed predominantly in testes. It encodes a protein with two RNA binding domains and a proline rich C-terminal portion. The DAZAP1 protein interacted with both DAZ and DAZL <italic>in vitro.</italic> It also bound to RNA homopolymers. We now report our characterization of the mouse <italic>Dazap1</italic> gene and its protein product. The subcellular localization of DAZAP1 suggests that it is not involved directly in mRNA translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of the mouse <italic>Dazap1</italic> cDNA</title><p>Mouse <italic>Dazap1</italic> cDNA clones were isolated by library screening, and the 5' end of the cDNA was isolated by 5' RACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The near fall length cDNA consists of a 53 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), an open reading frame for a protein of 405 amino acid residues, and a 362 bp 3' UTR (GenBank Accession No: AF225910). The coding region shares 89% similarity with that of the human orthologue. The 3' UTR sequence is remarkably conserved. It contains three segments of 35 bp, 133 bp and 90 bp that share 85%, 90%, and 97% similarity with segments in the human 3' UTR, respectively. These segments probably contain regulatory elements.</p><p>The DAZAP1 protein contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDS) and a C-terminal portion that is rich in proline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It is highly conserved evolutionarily. The mouse and the human proteins differ in 9 amino acids only, with 7 substitutions and two deletions/insertions. The mammalian proteins shares 89% similarity and 81% identity with <italic>Xenopus</italic> Prrp (for proline-rich RNA binding protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The two RBDs are especially highly conserved. They share 98% and 97% similarity and 97% and 92% identity, respectively, between DAZAP1 and Prrp. These proteins may therefore have a similar RNA binding specificity. The C-terminal proline-rich portions of DAZAP1 and Prrp are less conserved (81% similarity and 71% identity). There is an insertion of a 58 bp segment in Prrp cDNA that causes a change of reading frame and results in a shorter Prrp with a different C-terminal end sequence.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Evolutionary conservation of the DAZAP1 proteins.

Both antibodies recognized <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized DAZAP1 in an immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). Western blotting of mouse tissue extracts detected a 45 kD protein that was present most abundantly in the testis, and to a lesser degree in spleen, liver, lung and brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The protein was also present in the ovary. The expression of DAZAP1 during germ cell development paralleled that of DAZL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is present at a low level in the testes of 6 days old mice which contained only primitive type A spermatogonia.

A role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation is supported by lines of circumstantial evidence, including the association of DAZL with polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The absence of DAZAP1 from polyribosomes indicates that it is not directly involved in protein synthesis. This finding is different from two RNA-binding proteins, FXR1P and FXR2P, that were identified through their interaction with another polysomal-associated RNA-binding protein, the fragile X mental retardation protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both FXR1P and FXR2P are associated with the polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The significance of the interaction between DAZAP1 and DAZL/DAZ remains to be defined. These proteins may act together to facilitate the expression of a set of genes in germ cells. For example, DAZAP1 could be involved in the transport of the mRNAs of the target genes of DAZL. Alternatively, DAZL and DAZAP1 may act antagonistically to regulate the timing and the level of expression. Such an antagonistic interaction between two interacting RNA-binding proteins is exemplified by the neuron-specific nuclear RNA-binding protein, Nova-1. Nova-1 regulates the alternative splicing of the pre-mRNAs encoding neuronal inhibitory glycine receptor &#x003b1;2 (GlyR &#x003b1;2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The ability of Nova-1 to activate exon selection in neurons is antagonized by a second RNA-binding protein, brPTB (brain-enriched polypyrimidine tract-binding protein), which interacts with Nova-1 and inhibits its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. DAZAP1 could function in a similar manner by binding to DAZL and inhibiting its function. Comparing the phenotypes of <italic>Dazl1</italic> and <italic>Dazap1</italic> single and double knock-out mice may provide some clues to the significance of their interaction. <italic>Dazl1</italic> knock-out mice have already been generated and studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The spermatogenic defect in the male becomes apparent only after day 7 post partum when the germ cells are committing to meiosis (H. Cooke, personal communication). The genomic structure of <italic>Dazap1,</italic> delineated here, should facilitate the generating of <italic>Dazap1</italic> null mutation.</p><p>DAZAP1 was shown to bind RNA homopolymers <italic>in vitro,</italic> with a preference for poly U and poly G. Its natural substrates have not been identified. Recently, the <italic>Xenopus</italic> orthologue of DAZAP1, Prrp, was identified and characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Prrp binds to a 340 nt sequence in the 3' UTR of <italic>Xenopus Vg1</italic> mRNA. This Vg1 localization element (VLE) is sufficient for the migration and clustering of <italic>Vg1</italic> mRNA to the vegetal cortex of mature oocyte. Prrp also interacts through its proline-rich domain with two microfilament-associated proteins profilin and Mena, which may facilitate the anchoring of <italic>Vg1</italic> mRNA to the vegetal cortex. The <italic>Vg1</italic> RNA encodes a member of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; family that is required for generating dorsal mesoderm at the blastula stage of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Sequence conservation between the RBDs of DAZAP1 and Prrp suggests that these proteins may bind to similar RNA sequences. However, a BLAST search of the GenBank for the 340 nt VLE sequence failed to identify any mammalian sequences with significant homology. Further mapping of the RNA sequence within VLE that binds Prrp, and possibly DAZAP1, may help to identify the natural substrates of DAZAP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>DAZAP1 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein.

Both primer pairs annealed across intron insertion sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of anti-DAZAP1 antibodies</title><p>Antibodies were generated against both a recombinant protein produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and an oligopeptide synthesized <italic>in vitro.</italic> The insert of a <italic>Dazap1</italic> cDNA clone P21, which encoded the C-terminal portion of DAZAP1 (starting from aa #197), was cloned in-frame into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Xho</italic>I sites of an expression vector pET32b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Sequences at the junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. Milligrams of fusion proteins between thioredoxin and DAZAP1 were prepared and purified on His-Bind metal chelation resins (Novagen, Madison, WI). The proteins were mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits to generate the anti-DAZAPl-C antibody. An oligopeptide containing the last 19 ammo acid residues of the mouse DAZAP1 was synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using the services of Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The peptide was conjugated to KLH as carrier and injected into a goat. The anti-DAZAP1-P antibody thus produced was purified on an affinity column containing the oligopeptide antigen.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Mouse tissues were homogenized in the RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) at a concentration of 0.2 g tissue per ml of buffer. The homogenized samples were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes. Protein concentration of the tissue extracts was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). About 50 &#x003bc;g of tissue extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with either the anti-DAZAP1-C antibody (at a 1/2,000 dilution) or the anti-DAZAP1-P antibody (at a 1/5,000 dilution). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the binding of antibodies was detected using the ECL Western Blotting System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).</p></sec><sec><title>Fractionation of mouse testicular extracts</title><p>Adult mouse testes were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3% NP-40, 40 U/ml of Rnasin ribonuclase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and a mixture of 10 protease inhibitors provided in the Protease Inhibitors Set (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes to pellet cell debris and nuclei. After an additional centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes to pellet the mitochondria, aliquots of the supernatant were applied to 15&#x02013;45% sucrose gradients in 20 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the bottom of the tubes and analyzed by western blotting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Gary Kuo for his involvement in the construction of <italic>Dazap1</italic> expression vectors, and Ron Swerdloff's group for helpful discussion.
