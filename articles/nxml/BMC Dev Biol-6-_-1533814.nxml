Cubilin gene deletion is homozygous embryonic lethal with death occurring between 7.5&#x02013;13.5 days post coitum (dpc). Cubilin-deficient embryos display developmental retardation and do not advance morphologically beyond the gross appearance of wild-type 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc embryos. While mesodermal structures such as the allantois and the heart are formed in cubilin mutants, other mesoderm-derived tissues are anomalous or absent. Yolk sac blood islands are formed in cubilin mutants but are unusually large, and the yolk sac blood vessels fail to undergo remodeling. Furthermore, somite formation does not occur in cubilin mutants. Morphological abnormalities of endoderm occur in cubilin mutants and include a stratified epithelium in place of the normally simple columnar VE epithelium and a stratified cuboidal epithelium in place of the normally simple squamous epithelium of the definitive endoderm. Cubilin-deficient VE is also functionally defective, unable to mediate uptake of maternally derived high-density lipoprotein (HDL).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, cubilin is required for embryonic development and is essential for the formation of somites, definitive endoderm and VE and for the absorptive function of VE including the process of maternal-embryo transport of HDL.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cubilin is a 460-kDa peripheral membrane protein expressed by a number of absorptive epithelial cells including those of the renal proximal convoluted tubule, ileum and yolk sac extraembryonic visceral endoderm (VE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The first described function of cubilin was as the receptor for intrinsic factor-vitamin B<sub>12</sub>/cobalamin (Cbl), serving a critical role in the intestinal absorption of Cbl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Cubilin was later shown to be an endocytic receptor for apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)/high density lipoprotein (HDL), mediating uptake of HDL in the kidney and VE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other cubilin ligands include albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin light chains, vitamin D-binding protein, myoglobin, galectin-3 and Clara cell secretory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Three cell surface integral membrane proteins have been shown to interact with cubilin. The first identified was megalin, an endocytic receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Megalin functions together with cubilin to mediate endocytosis of apoA-I/HDL, presumably facilitating endocytosis of the cubilin-apoA-I/HDL complex. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II-receptor (CIMPR) is another endocytic receptor that binds to cubilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although the functional significance of its interaction with cubilin remains to be established. The ~48-kDa type I transmembrane protein, amnionless (AMN), is the most recent integral membrane protein found to interact with cubilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. AMN is essential for efficient transport of cubilin to the apical cell surface as well as for membrane anchoring of cubilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>],</p><p>Given the fact that cubilin is expressed by trophectoderm and VE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it is believed to play an important role in maternal-embryonic transport of nutrients. Several additional pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. First, cubilin has been shown to mediate VE uptake of holoparticle HDL, HDL-associated cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the work of Sahali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] demonstrated that cubilin monoclonal antibodies infused into circulation of pregnant rats (9 dpc), bound to VE cubilin and induced a spectrum of developmental abnormalities and embryonic resorption within 24&#x02013;48 hours of infusion. The abnormalities included retarded embryonic growth, craniofacial defects involving the eye, ear and neural tube, hydrocephaly and telencephalic hypoplasia. Similarly, growth retardation and morphological anomalies were obtained when rat embryos (10 dpc) were cultured <italic>ex utero </italic>in the presence of cubilin antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here we characterize the consequences of targeted deletion of the mouse cubilin gene on embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of cubilin<sup>-/- </sup>mice</title><p>To generate mice with targeted disruption of the cubilin gene (and concomitant knock-in of the EGFP reporter gene) we cloned and fully mapped the exon-intron structure of the 5' portion of the murine cubilin gene. A mouse cubilin gene-targeting vector was designed to create a null mutation through deletion of exons 1&#x02013;6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). After electroporation of the construct and G418 positive selection and FIAU negative selection, ten ES clones (out of 132 screened) were identified that had the desired recombination based on Southern analysis (using both upstream and downstream flanking probes) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Targeted ES clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and the blastocysts were transferred to foster mothers to obtain chimeric mice. Two male chimeras were obtained from the first targeted ES cell line tested and found to be germ line competent through the generation of heterozygous offspring. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Southern analysis confirmed that offspring from one of these mice contained the properly targeted cubilin allele.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Targeted deletion of the mouse cubilin gene</bold>. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, is a diagram of the structural and functional domains of cubilin.

The promoter-less EGFP (containing Kozak and ATG sequences) and loxP-floxed neo<sup>R </sup>cassettes were inserted into exon 1, 33 bp upstream of the cubilin ATG and 16 bp downstream from the proximal-most transcription initiation site, resulting in a replacement of the majority of exon 1.

Additionally, the wild-type allele yields an 11.3 kb band and the knockout allele yields a 7 kb band when genomic DNA is digested with BglII and hybridized with the 3' probe. The results show that the correct recombinant allele is present in the selected ES cell clone. <bold><italic>D</italic></bold>, Southern analysis of BglII digested tail DNA from a wild-type (WT) and a correctly targeted heterozygous (-/+) mouse.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-6-30-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>The cubilin exon 1&#x02013;6 deletion leads to embryonic lethality</title><p>Genotypic analysis was performed on 220 offspring from heterozygous intercross matings. As a result, 100 wild-type, 120 heterozygous and no homozygous offspring were detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These non-Mendelian ratios indicate that lethality occurs in embryos homozygous for the targeted cubilin gene deletion. Furthermore, since the frequency of heterozygotes at 4 weeks was much lower than expected (1:1 versus the expected 2:1 heterozygous:wild-type ratio), embryonic lethality appeared to be occurring in some heterozygotes. To substantiate this possibility we performed genotypic analysis of 181 4-wk offspring from wild-type &#x000d7; heterozygote matings. As a result, 109 wild-type and 72 heterozygous offspring were detected. Based on a chi-square test of these data and a resulting <italic>p </italic>value = 0.0074, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of cubilin causes embryonic lethality, although with incomplete penetrance.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Genotype frequency of progeny from heterozygote (<italic>cubilin </italic>exon1&#x02013;6<sup>+/-</sup>) matings</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Stage</td><td align="center" colspan="3">No. Progeny of Each Genotype</td><td align="center">No. Resorbed Embryos</td><td align="center">Total No.</td><td align="center">Chi-Square <italic>p </italic>value</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">+/+</td><td align="center">+/-</td><td align="center">-/-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">7.5 dpc</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">34</td><td align="center">0.767</td></tr><tr><td align="left">8.5 dpc</td><td align="center">23</td><td align="center">29</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">70</td><td align="center">0.319</td></tr><tr><td align="left">9.5 dpc</td><td align="center">22</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">60</td><td align="center">0.002</td></tr><tr><td align="left">10.5 dpc</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">37</td><td align="center">0.018</td></tr><tr><td align="left">13.5 dpc</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">45</td><td align="center">0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Adult (4 wk)</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">120</td><td align="center">0</td><td></td><td align="center">220</td><td align="center">0.0001*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Asterisk indicates that the chi-square test was based on a 1:2 ratio of wild-type to heterozygote offspring.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Retrograde genotypic analysis was performed on embryos from heterozygous intercross matings (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). At 7.5 dpc homozygous embryos were obtained at a frequency consistent with a normal Mendelian ratio. From 8.5&#x02013;10.5 dpc, homozygous embryos were detected, but not at a frequency in accordance with Mendelian expectations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). After 13.5 dpc, no homozygous embryos were detected. Together, these findings indicate that homozygous embryos die over a range of developmental stages between 7.5 to 13.5 dpc. Consistent with this conclusion was the relatively high number of embryo resorptions observed after 7.5 dpc (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>To establish that embryos homozygous for the targeted cubilin gene deletion of exons 1&#x02013;6 were indeed cubilin null, RT-PCR analysis was performed using two primer pairs designed to amplify separate 5' and 3' regions of the cubilin transcript. No cubilin mRNA was detectable by either primer pair using RNA isolated from homozygous 8.5 dpc embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

In contrast, 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc wild-type littermates had formed 3&#x02013;9 somites. Other mesodermal structures did form in the 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc mutants, albeit with some variability. For example, an allantois was present in 5 of 7 mutant 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc embryos examined. Most mutant embryos (5 of 7) also had an amnion and chorion, tissues having mesoderm components. While blood islands formed in the yolk sacs of all 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc mutants they appeared unusually large, extending into the exocoelomic cavity to a greater extent than wild-type blood islands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Such blood islands appeared to have a larger than normal number of mesodermal cells. Additionally, blood island hematopoietic development appeared to be retarded as evidenced by the failure of the cells to exhibit the characteristic rounded hematopoietic cell morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Enlargement of blood islands in cubilin mutants</bold>.

Homozygous embryos surviving beyond 9.5 dpc (i.e., 11.5 dpc) were also grossly similar to wild-type 8.0 dpc embryos, but still lacked somites (data not shown). Together these findings indicate that lack of cubilin results in developmental retardation that initiates prior to 8.0 dpc, and a failure to achieve developmental milestones appropriate for a wild-type 8.0 dpc embryo, most notably, failure to form somites. The complete lack of somites at 9.5 dpc suggests that the basis is due to some defect of the paraxial mesoderm rather than merely being a consequence of retarded development.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cubilin-deficient 9.5 dpc embryos are developmentally retarded and lack somites</bold>. <bold><italic>A </italic></bold>shows a wild-type 9.5 dpc embryo and <bold><italic>B </italic></bold>a mutant littermate.

Since this abnormality was not observed in 9.5 dpc mutants, it can be concluded that dysmorphogenesis of the allantoic vasculature occurs after 9.5 dpc and perhaps contributes to a chorioallantoic placental defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Abnormalities of embryonic and visceral endoderm in cubilin mutants</title><p>Considering that cubilin is normally present on the apical surface of the columnar VE (from 6.0 dpc to at least 9.5 dpc) and on a population of the squamous cells within the embryonic endoderm (EE) (from 7.3&#x02013;8.0 dpc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we next evaluated the impact of cubilin deficiency on these embryonic endodermal tissues. Examination of homozygous 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc embryos revealed a number of endodermal anomalies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In place of a normal squamous definitive endoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), the mutant embryos had both cuboidal and columnar cells arranged in a stratified cuboidal epithelium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, <italic>arrow</italic>) as well as simple columnar epithelium (not shown). Additionally, mutant cells in these epithelia had apical processes that may be either microvilli or cilia. Such luminal surface structures are normally not found on EE cells. Based on the findings, the absence of cubilin inhibits the formation of an epithelium morphologically comparable to that of a normal definitive endoderm at this stage, however, it remains to be determined whether this is a result of a defect in the specification and differentiation of the definitive endoderm.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Cubilin mutants display anomalies in the epithelial morphology of embryonic endoderm</bold>.

In contrast to the simple columnar VE of normal embryos, the VE of cubilin mutants was a stratified epithelium, comprised of cuboidal and columnar cells. Furthermore, mutant VE cells also lacked the large apical vacuoles that are characteristic of VE cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). Given the morphological similarities between the cells of mutant embryonic endoderm there was not a discernable demarcation between the normally distinct EE and VE epithelia. However, a clear demarcation between the VE and an epithelium that would normally be EE was evident upon immunohistological analysis of GFP reporter expression (from the EGFP cassette inserted into the cubilin gene) and megalin expression in mutant 8.0 dpc embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This indicated that although being morphologically similar, the VE and presumed EE of mutants were distinct at the molecular level. Furthermore, the fact that megalin was appropriately expressed on the apical surfaces of the mutant VE indicated that cubilin is not required to direct cell surface trafficking of megalin.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Green fluorescent protein and megalin expression in yolk sac visceral endoderm of mutant embryos</bold>.

Like the cubilin null embryos, AMN-deficient embryos display arrested development, with most mutants not advancing morphologically beyond a normal 8&#x02013;8.5 dpc embryo. On a mixed 129Sv/C57BL/6 genetic background, both mutants form an amnion. General mesoderm formation in the cubilin and AMN mutant embryos appears normal in that both mutants form an allantois, blood islands, yolk sac blood vessels and a heart. However, both mutants fail to form somites, indicating that somitogenesis is in some manner defective (e.g., insufficient paraxial mesoderm or defective condensation and/or segmentation). Both mutants also display endoderm defects as evidenced by the inability of cubilin-deficient VE to facilitate uptake of maternal HDL and the inability of AMN-deficient VE and EE to support wild-type epiblast development in chimeric embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The morphological abnormalities of VE and definitive endoderm observed in the cubilin mutants also highlight the importance of cubilin in formation and/or maintenance of these epithelia. Such morphological abnormalities were not reported in the phenotype of AMN-deficient mutants. It remains to be established whether cubilin and AMN are playing roles in the specification and differentiation of the definitive endoderm, which forms during gastrulation by the recruitment of epiblast cells through the primitive streak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The close similarities between the phenotypes of mouse <italic>amn </italic>and <italic>cubilin </italic>mutants also suggest that both genes act co-operatively in the VE to support embryonic growth and to control the formation of paraxial mesoderm. How AMN and cubilin mechanistically mediate these processes remains to be resolved. The endocytic function of the <italic>cubam </italic>complex and its apical expression in VE supports the possibility that it functions in the transport of vital maternal nutrients/factors. The spectrum of maternally derived nutrients/factors transported by VE <italic>cubam </italic>is potentially quite broad considering the multi-ligand binding capacity of cubilin which includes albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin light chains, vitamin D-binding protein, myoglobin, galectin-3, Clara cell secretory protein, apoA-I and HDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, at least one cubilin ligand, HDL, is a complex of multiple factors including apolipoproteins, phospholipids, cholesterol and lipid soluble vitamins such as retinol, which is converted to retinoic acid through the action of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2). Indeed, genetic deficiency of mouse Raldh2 leads to early embryo lethality (~10.5 dpc), absence or reduction in somites, yolk sac vascular defects, enlarged heart and a failure of embryos to undergo axial rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], all similar to <italic>cubilin </italic>and <italic>amn </italic>mutants.</p><p>By contrast to the developmental anomalies and early lethality of the cubilin and amnionless nulls, megalin-deficient mice die perinatally and display abnormal morphogenesis of the forebrain (e.g., holoprosencephaly), lung and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, despite the evidence that megalin functions together with cubilin and that it is co-expressed with cubilin in the VE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], any joint function that these two proteins may have in the early embryo is evidently not vital. Interestingly, mice deficient in disabled-2 (dab2), an adaptor of megalin, display several of the abnormalities observed in cubilin nulls including disorganization of the VE and loss of apical vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, dab2<sup>-/- </sup>mutants arrest earlier in development than do cubilin nulls and do not undergo gastrulation. Dab2 has also been shown to be required for cubilin endocytosis in VE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The earlier lethality of dab2 null embryos may be an indication that numerous endocytic receptors expressed in the VE including megalin, cubilin and perhaps amnionless are dependent on dab2.</p><p>The importance of maternal derived lipoproteins as a source of cholesterol for normal development is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Through the use of cubilin antagonists, the ability of cubilin to mediate VE uptake of holoparticle HDL, HDL-associated cholesterol and apoA-I has been demonstrated in mouse embryos cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our findings provide <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence that early (8.0 dpc) embryonic uptake of HDL from the maternal circulation is a cubilin-dependent process of the VE. Given the fact that the VE expresses apoA-I and the major LDL constituent, apoB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it is likely that cholesterol and other maternal HDL-derived constituents taken up by VE cells via cubilin are incorporated into new HDL and LDL particles and subsequently delivered to the embryo. In support of this, there is evidence that nascent lipoprotein particles have been localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles of the 9.5 dpc mouse yolk sac and seen in the pericellular space underlying the endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that cubilin and AMN deficiency in mice leads to embryonic lethality, mutations in human and canine <italic>AMN </italic>that cause impaired apical targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and function (i.e., malabsorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) of the <italic>cubam </italic>complex, nevertheless have no effect on embryonic development. One explanation for this apparent paradox may relate to the fact that there are species differences in yolk sac function in rodents, dogs and humans. Another explanation comes from the studies of Tanner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] who have shown that mutations affecting exons 1&#x02013;4 of human <italic>AMN </italic>(OMIM 261100, megaloblastic anemia, MGA1) do not prevent the production variant transcripts and polypeptides resulting from alternative transcriptional start sites and alternative translation initiation sites. Indeed, the two <italic>AMN </italic>mutants that cause premature termination of translation (14&#x00394;G and 208-2A&#x02192;G) also express an alternative AMN polypeptide of 40 kDa and several minor species of 44, 42 and 38 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. All of the alternative AMN polypeptides would contain the chordin-like module, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain, but would lack various lengths of the amino terminal portion of the full-length protein. While these alternative polypeptides apparently are missing regions required for vitamin B<sub>12 </sub>uptake, they evidently confer enough normal function to sustain embryonic development. How these alternative polypeptides function, particularly with respect to cubilin, remains to be established. One possibility is that they retain the ability to mediate trafficking of cubilin to the apical surfaces of epithelial cells. However, mutations of the canine AMN gene that disrupt cubilin intracellular trafficking have no apparent effect on embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is not known whether the canine AMN mutants express alternative AMN polypeptides similar to those observed in humans. If so, it is possible that the polypeptides possess some activity that overcomes the need for apical expression of the <italic>cubam </italic>complex to mediate normal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study reveals an indispensable role for cubilin in mouse embryogenesis particularly in the formation of endoderm and somites.
