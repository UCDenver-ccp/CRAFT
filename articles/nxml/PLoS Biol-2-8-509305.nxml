Several strains of gene-targeted mice have been reported to develop SLE, implicating the null genes in the causation of disease. However, hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 mice, widely used in the generation of gene-targeted mice, develop spontaneous autoimmunity. Furthermore, the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype of SLE in gene-targeted mice. This suggests an important role in the expression of autoimmunity of as-yet-uncharacterised background genes originating from these parental mouse strains. Using genome-wide linkage analysis, we identified several susceptibility loci, derived from 129 and C57BL/6 mice, mapped in the lupus-prone hybrid (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) model. By creating a C57BL/6 congenic strain carrying a 129-derived Chromosome 1 segment, we found that this 129 interval was sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, which had previously been attributed to a disrupted gene. These results demonstrate important epistatic modifiers of autoimmunity in 129 and C57BL/6 mouse strains, widely used in gene targeting. These background gene influences may account for some, or even all, of the autoimmune traits described in some gene-targeted models of SLE.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Several strains of gene-targeted mice develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Genetic predisposition is an important contributor to susceptibility to SLE in both humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Vyse1">Vyse and Todd 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Harley1">Harley et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Theofilopoulos2">Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Wakeland1">Wakeland et al. 2001</xref>). Genes in multiple pathways participate in mediating disease pathogenesis, and epistatic interactions amongst these genes influence the expression of disease. In this context, both genetic linkage studies in spontaneous lupus-prone models and synthetic murine models of autoimmunity generated by targeted disruption of specific genes modulating the immune system have widely been used to investigate the complexity of SLE.</p><p>The best-studied strains of mice that spontaneously develop a lupus-like pathology are the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White hybrid strain (NZB/WF1); the MRL/Mp <italic>lpr/lpr</italic> strain, which carries the <italic>lpr</italic> mutation of the FAS receptor gene; and the BXSB strain, which carries the Y chromosome autoimmune accelerator (<italic>Yaa</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Theofilopoulos1">Theofilopoulos and Dixon 1985</xref>). Extensive genetic mapping studies in all three strains have identified multiple intervals associated with disease susceptibility. Interestingly, the majority of the intervals detected are strain-specific, confirming the genetic complexity of the disease and indicating the presence of extensive heterogeneity in the genes contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease. However, some susceptibility loci have been mapped to similar chromosome locations in different strains, suggesting that at least some susceptibility may be shared amongst lupus-prone strains. Amongst these shared susceptibility loci, the most striking are loci on distal Chromosome 1, for which important contributing genes have been found in New Zealand and BXSB models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Theofilopoulos2">Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Wakeland1">Wakeland et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Although considerable efforts have been made to identify the genes responsible for the development of the disease, with the exception of the <italic>lpr</italic> mutation, none of the genetic contributions to disease in the three well-documented murine SLE strains have yet been fully resolved at the molecular or protein level. Thus, targeted genetic disruption of candidate genes encoding proteins of the immune system has been extensively used to examine their role in immune regulation. However, the most surprising result of this powerful approach has been the high frequency with which such mutations have been associated with an autoimmune phenotype. In this regard, it is of note that hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 mice, widely used in the generation of gene-targeted mice, are spontaneously predisposed to development of humoral autoimmunity with low levels of glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Obata1">Obata et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Botto2">Botto et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bickerstaff1">Bickerstaff et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Santiago-Raber1">Santiago-Raber et al. 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype in gene-targeted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bolland1">Bolland and Ravetch 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Santiago-Raber1">Santiago-Raber et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Mitchell1">Mitchell et al. 2002</xref>). These observations led to the hypothesis that the autoimmune phenotype described in some gene-targeted mice might be due primarily to combinations of as-yet-uncharacterised background genes, originating from 129 and C57BL/6 mice strains, interacting or not with the mutated allele. To test this, we conducted a genome-wide scan analysis of two large cohorts of (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2 mice, one of which carried a mutation in the serum amyloid P component gene (<italic>Apcs</italic>). The <italic>Apcs</italic>-deficient mice (<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) were chosen as an example of a gene-targeted strain previously reported to develop a lupus-like disease on the hybrid genetic background (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6); autoimmunity in <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice persists even after backcrossing the mutated gene onto C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bickerstaff1">Bickerstaff et al. 1999</xref>). We chose this targeted gene in particular to study since the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene is located on Chromosome 1, approximately 94 cM from the centromere, within a region where several lupus-susceptibility loci, designated <italic>Sle1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Morel2">Morel et al. 2001</xref>), <italic>Nba2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Drake1">Drake et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Vyse2">Vyse et al. 1997</xref>), and <italic>Bxs3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Hogarth1">Hogarth et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Haywood1">Haywood et al. 2000</xref>), have been mapped in NZW, NZB, and BXSB lupus-prone strains, respectively. This region contains several genes, including those encoding Fc&#x003b3;RII, the complement receptor CR1/2 (CD35/CD21), and the decay-accelerating factor CD55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Prodeus1">Prodeus et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bolland1">Bolland and Ravetch 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Miwa1">Miwa et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Wu1">Wu et al. 2002</xref>), which have each been implicated in the causation of SLE when inactivated by gene-targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Here we show that there are multiple genetic loci, derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 mice, contributing to autoimmunity. Furthermore, a 129-derived interval on distal Chromosome 1, when transferred onto the C57BL/6 genome, a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a gene that has been inactivated in 129 embryonic stem cells, was sufficient to cause humoral autoimmunity in its own right, irrespective of the presence of the mutated <italic>Apcs</italic> gene. These results demonstrate important epistatic interactions between genes from 129 and C57BL/6 genomes on the development of autoimmunity and illustrate the important effects of background genes in the analysis and interpretation of autoimmune phenotypes associated with targeted genetic disruptions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Disease Traits in (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2 and (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice</title><p>To investigate the genetic basis of the lupus-like disease observed in the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) hybrid mice, we generated two large cohorts of (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2 animals, one carrying a mutation in the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene, and monitored them for 1 y under identical environmental conditions. Since female mice in the original reports showed a higher penetrance of disease, the present study was conducted only on female mice. The results of the phenotypic analysis at 1 y of age are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020243-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020243-t002">2</xref>. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Botto2">Botto et al. 1998</xref>), the wild-type (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2 mice developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto-Abs, starting from 6 mo of age (data not shown), and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis. In agreement with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bickerstaff1">Bickerstaff et al. 1999</xref>), the titres of anti-nuclear Abs (ANAs) and anti-chromatin Ab were considerably greater in the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with the strain-matched controls. However, in contrast to our original findings, the levels of the other two disease serological markers analysed (anti-single-stranded DNA &#x0005b;ssDNA&#x0005d; and anti-double-stranded DNA &#x0005b;dsDNA&#x0005d; Abs) and the severity of the renal pathology were not different between the two experimental groups. In view of the possibility of an association between the fixed 129-derived segment flanking the mutated <italic>Apcs</italic> gene and the autoimmune traits observed, the genome-wide linkage analysis of the two experimental cohorts was carried out separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mapping of Loci Predisposing to Lupus in the Hybrid Strain (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)</title><p>Mice were genotyped with 143 microsatellite markers distributed throughout the autosomes such that 98&#x00025; of the genes were within 20 cM of an informative marker.

Interestingly, whilst ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels showed suggestive or significant linkages only to the telomeric region of Chromosome 1, with an estimated peak occurring at a position approximately 90 cM near the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene, anti-dsDNA or anti-ssDNA Ab production was also linked to other segments on Chromosome 1, indicating a more complex genetic contribution from the 129 mouse strain.</p><p>Guided by these observations, we investigated whether the increased levels of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab observed in the <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were caused by a gene(s) within the fixed 129 region surrounding the mutated <italic>Apcs</italic> gene, rather than caused by the mutated <italic>Apcs</italic> gene itself. We compared the levels of these auto-Abs between all (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and a group of 33 wild-type mice that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the region of Chromosome 1 between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 (80&#x02013;106 cM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020243-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020243-g006">6</xref>D). In contrast to the results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020243-t001">Table 1</xref>, this comparison showed no significant differences between the two experimental groups. This result demonstrates that, most likely, the 129-derived region and not the lack of <italic>Apcs</italic> was mediating the production of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab. Consistent with this explanation, we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of <italic>Apcs</italic> in circulation compared with the C57BL/6 mice (median, 83 mg/l; range, 25&#x02013;208; <italic>n</italic> = 16 versus median, 5 mg/l; range, 4&#x02013;9; <italic>n</italic> = 10, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The C57BL/6 strain has previously been reported to be one of the murine strains defined as low <italic>Apcs</italic> producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Pepys3">Pepys et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Baltz1">Baltz et al. 1980</xref>). In addition, sequence analysis of the entire <italic>Apcs</italic> coding region in both strains failed to identify any coding sequence polymorphisms in the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene (data not shown), indicating that a structural variant of the protein is unlikely to be the explanation for our findings. This is consistent with a previous report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Drake2">Drake et al. (1996)</xref> that showed no <italic>Apcs</italic> coding sequence differences amongst several autoimmune and nonautoimmune murine strains.</p><p>In addition to the 129-derived segments, in both cohorts the C57BL/6 strain contributed to the autoimmune traits with one major susceptibility locus on Chromosome 3. A genomic region between D3Mit40 and D3Mit13, with an estimated peak at position approximately 51 cM, showed a significant linkage to ANA production and weaker linkages to anti-ssDNA and anti-chromatin production (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020243-t003">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020243-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The high frequency of autoimmune phenotype in the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) hybrid genetic background and its absence in either of the inbred parental strains imply that there are essential interactions between 129- and C57BL/6-derived alleles for the expression of autoimmunity. We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL/6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2 mice, whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Zeng1">Zeng 1994</xref>). The results of this analysis showed that the statistical support for the linkage of the C57BL/6 locus on Chromosome 3 for ANA increased from logarithm of odds (LOD) 5.4 to LOD 6.4.</p><p>In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers, the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis: one in the wild-type mice on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 (15 cM) and D7Mit145 (26.5 cM) of 129 origin (LOD 2.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0013), and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 (11.7 cM) and D17Mit216 (29.4 cM) from the C57BL/6 strain (LOD 1.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.049 and LOD 1.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021 in the wild-type and <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, respectively). Histological evidence of glomerulonephritis was only found in approximately 20&#x00025; of the mice in each cohort, which reduces the power of the QTL analysis for this disease trait.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Production of a C57BL/6.129 Chromosome 1 Congenic Line and Its Phenotypic Analysis</title><p>We generated a C57BL/6 congenic line carrying the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 from the 129 mouse strain, in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the (C57BL/6 &#x000d7; 129/Sv)F2 hybrid strain into its individual genetic components. The 129 interval was backcrossed seven times onto C57BL/6, and at each generation the presence or absence of the Chromosome 1 interval was determined with several microsatellite markers. Each backcrossed generation was screened with more than three markers per chromosome to facilitate the removal of unselected 129 genomic regions. At the end of the backcrossing, the 129-derived Chromosome 1 interval in the congenic mice extended from microsatellite marker D1Mit105 to D1Mit223 (80&#x02013;106 cM), which encompasses the most important 129 interval identified by the linkage studies in the (C57BL/6 &#x000d7; 129/Sv)F2 mice.</p><p>Female Chromosome 1 congenic mice (C57BL/6.129&#x0005b;D1Mit105&#x02013;223&#x0005d;), together with sex-matched <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations (C57BL/6.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and C57BL/6 controls, were monitored for the presence of lupus. In the C57BL/6.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the 129 genome around the <italic>Apcs</italic> locus was mapped as a stretch of approximately 17 cM, positioned from 87.9 cM (D1Mit15) to 105 cM (D1Mit17). Thus, the congenic line carried a similar 129 region (80&#x02013;106 cM) to the one present in the C57BL/6.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (87.9&#x02013;105 cM). At 1 y of age, all animals were sacrificed, the auto-Abs assessed, and the renal histology examined.

However, the C57BL/6.129(D1Mit105&#x02013;223) animals also expressed high levels of auto-Abs, and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null mutation of the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene. These results clearly demonstrated that epistatic interactions between 129 loci on Chromosome 1 and C57BL/6 genes were sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear autoantigens.

The same consideration applies to other genes located in the same Chromosome 1 region that have been implicated in the development of SLE when inactivated by gene-targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed onto a pure genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bolland1">Bolland and Ravetch 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Miwa1">Miwa et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Wu1">Wu et al. 2002</xref>). For each, there has to be a question as to whether the anti-nuclear autoimmunity is due to the gene-targeted mutant gene or to the normal 129 genes expressed in the same region as the targeted gene.</p><p>The influence of background genes on the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease is well known, especially with respect to the <italic>lpr</italic> and <italic>Yaa</italic> disease-susceptibility genes. In MRL/Mp mice, the presence of the <italic>lpr</italic> gene accelerates the development of high level and broad-spectrum auto-Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis, in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease. In contrast, homozygosity of the <italic>lpr</italic> gene in other strains such as C57BL/6, AKR, LG/J, and C3H leads only to auto-Ab production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Izui1">Izui et al. 1984</xref>). Similarly, the Y-chromosome-linked <italic>Yaa</italic> gene in BXSB and MRL/Mp males enhances the rapid development of auto-Abs and glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Izui2">Izui et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Merino1">Merino et al. 1989</xref>). However, in the C57BL/6 background, the <italic>Yaa</italic> gene does not lead to an autoimmune phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Izui2">Izui et al. 1988</xref>). Not surprisingly, important effects of the genetic background on the expression of autoimmunity have also been reported in gene-targeted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bolland1">Bolland and Ravetch 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Santiago-Raber1">Santiago-Raber et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Mitchell1">Mitchell et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, SLE exists as a complex-trait disorder in which specific combinations of susceptibility alleles are required for the expression of the full phenotype.</p><p>Through the use of microsatellite marker maps, the identification of murine SLE susceptibility intervals in experimental crosses has been made possible. These mapping studies have shown that the disease expression in relation to the inheritance of the different alleles followed a threshold liability pattern in which a positive phenotype depended upon the presence of multiple discrete susceptibility loci with no single locus being a prerequisite factor. We have employed the same approach to analyse the genetic basis of disease inheritance in the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) hybrid strain, the most common genetic background in gene-targeted mice. Although spontaneous autoimmunity has not been documented in either of the pure 129 or C57BL/6 strains, a spontaneous lupus-like phenotype has been described in (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) hybrid strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Obata1">Obata et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Botto2">Botto et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bickerstaff1">Bickerstaff et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Santiago-Raber1">Santiago-Raber et al. 2001</xref>), suggesting that the predisposition in these hybrid mice may arise as a result of the interaction between specific combinations of alleles inherited from both the 129 and C57BL/6 parental strains.</p><p>This was confirmed by the mapping study reported here. We showed that there are multiple genetic loci contributing to the disease and these are derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrated that a 129-derived segment of Chromosome 1 was strongly linked to the expression of auto-Abs. This region is probably capable of causing the initiation of a humoral autoimmune response to nuclear antigens; however, this response does not occur in the absence of C57BL/6 genes. In support of this, we identified a C57BL/6 segment on Chromosome 3, which may interact with the 129 genes on Chromosome 1 to mediate the loss of tolerance. Interestingly, although the C57BL/6 SLE-susceptibility region on Chromosome 3 is novel, disease-modifying alleles derived from C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 strains have been mapped to a portion of Chromosome 3 close to the region identified in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Morel1">Morel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Haywood1">Haywood et al. 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Santiago1">Santiago et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Morel1">Morel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Xie1">Xie et al. 2002</xref>), suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci.</p><p>Taken together our results suggest a complex genetic contribution from the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6) hybrid background genome, with both enhancing as well as inhibitory loci from the 129 mouse, in addition to genes promoting autoimmunity from the C57BL/6 mice. The impact that these interacting loci may have on the lupus-like disease present in several gene-targeted animals was further assessed by comparing <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls.</p><p>In the context of SLE susceptibility, one of the most consistently mapped non-MHC regions of the mouse genome is the telomeric Chromosome 1 segment, where several disease loci, designated <italic>Sle1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Morel2">Morel et al. 2001</xref>), <italic>Nba2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Drake1">Drake et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Rozzo1">Rozzo et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Vyse2">Vyse et al. 1997</xref>), and <italic>Bxs3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Hogarth1">Hogarth et al. 1998</xref>), have been mapped in lupus-prone strains. Moreover, this region of mouse Chromosome 1 is orthologous to a region on human Chromosome 1q22&#x02013;1q25, which has also been linked with human SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Moser1">Moser et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Apcs</italic> gene is one of the candidate genes known to lie within this region. The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA, chromatin, and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Pepys1">Pepys 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Pepys2">Pepys and Butler 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Butler1">Butler et al. 1990</xref>) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Hintner1">Hintner et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Breathnach1">Breathnach et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Familian1">Familian et al. 2001</xref>). We have previously reported that (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6).<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bickerstaff1">Bickerstaff et al. 1999</xref>). On the basis of these observations, it was postulated that <italic>Apcs</italic>, by altering the clearance of chromatin, contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. However, in this study we found that only ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the <italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains. Furthermore, the whole-genome analysis identified the 129 region surrounding the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene as the main locus contributing to the development of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab. In agreement with this, when we carried out a selective comparison between the (129 &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F2.<italic>Apcs</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls, we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto-Abs. These findings, taken together, indicated that the phenotype associated with <italic>Apcs</italic> deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL/6 genomic background. Strong supportive evidence for this was provided by the analysis of the C57BL/6 mice congenic for this 129 region.</p><p>The generation and analysis of congenic strains have successfully been used to dissect the contribution of individual susceptibility alleles to a multigenic trait such as SLE. We adopted the same strategy to investigate the relative contribution of the 129 Chromosome 1 segment and the <italic>Apcs</italic> gene to each disease trait. Using this approach, we demonstrated that the 129 interval on distal Chromosome 1, when transferred onto the C57BL/6 genome, a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a mutated gene located in that chromosomal region, was sufficient to mediate the production of auto-Abs. In this context, it is of note that several strains of mice with targeted mutations of genes encoded in this region have been reported to express a lupus-like illness, including mice lacking Fc&#x003b3;RIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Bolland1">Bolland and Ravetch 2000</xref>), complement receptors (CR1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Prodeus1">Prodeus et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Wu1">Wu et al. 2002</xref>), and decay-accelerating factor (CD55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Miwa1">Miwa et al. 2002</xref>). In each case, the autoimmune phenotype was described in mice in which the null mutation was generated in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed to the C57BL/6 or another genetic background. Thus, in view of our findings, one may postulate that in each of these murine models of SLE, the effects of the targeted null gene were irrelevant. Similar conclusions may apply to other gene-targeted animals carrying mutations of genes mapped in the 129-derived susceptibility allele on Chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-OaKeefe1">O'Keefe et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-OaKeefe2">1999</xref>).</p><p>The expression of anti-nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the <italic>Apcs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. The only difference in phenotype between these mice was in the expression of glomerulonephritis, which was more pronounced in the <italic>Apcs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared with the congenic mice. Although these findings demonstrate that <italic>Apcs</italic> is not implicated in the processing of autoantigens, as it had previously been suggested, they indicate that <italic>Apcs</italic> might still play an important protective role in lupus nephritis. In support of this, the expression of the human C-reactive protein, an acute-phase protein closely related to <italic>Apcs</italic>, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB/W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Szalai1">Szalai et al. 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, a polymorphism associated with reduced basal level of C-reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020243-Russell1">Russell et al. 2004</xref>). However, as the congenic mice and the <italic>Apcs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1, an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 genes involved in self-tolerance and end organ damage. Thus, whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus, further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of <italic>Apc</italic>s in the pathogenesis of renal damage.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate the impact of epistatic interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 genomes on the development of SLE and illustrate how these background gene effects may lead to incorrect interpretations when analysing the autoimmune phenotype of specific genetic disruptions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Mice.</title><p>All the mice were females.
