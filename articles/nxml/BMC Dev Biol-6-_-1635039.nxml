This subset of pluripotent neural crest stem cells forms in the dorsal aspect of the neural tube at the level of the mid-otic placode to the third somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Subsequently cardiac neural crest cells (CNCCs) delaminate, undergo a phenotypic transformation from an epithelial to mesenchymal cell type, and migrate latero-ventrally into the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), where they contribute to the formation of the smooth muscle cell layer of endothelial structures derived from the aortic arch arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A subset of CNCCs continues to migrate deeper into the aortic sac to form the aortico-pulmonary septum; a vital structure, which separates the pulmonary trunk from the aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>An indispensable role of CNCCs in the development of the cardiac outflow tract was originally demonstrated by pioneering studies of Kirby and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], who showed that ablation of the CNC in the chick led to severe outflow tract (OFT) defects including persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), mispatterning of the great vessels and outflow tract mal-alignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Early migratory CNCCs have been shown to retain a considerable degree of plasticity and their fate is largely controlled by instructional signals from local environments into which NCCs migrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several recent studies have indicated that members of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, i.e., TGF-&#x003b2;s and BMPs are likely candidates to provide some of these signals. Mice deficient in TGF-&#x003b2;2 display fourth aortic arch artery defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while neural crest cell specific abrogation of TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (<italic>Tgfbr2</italic>) results in interruption of the aortic arch and PTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. BMPs 6 and -7 are required for proper formation of the outflow tract cushions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while BMP type II receptor is needed for proper development of the conotruncal ridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, neural crest-specific deletion of the BMP type I receptors <italic>Alk2 </italic>and <italic>Alk3 </italic>has been shown to lead to defective aortico-pulmonary septation, among other cardiac defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; subfamily ligands signal via a receptor complex composed of two type II receptors and two type I receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Ligand binding leads to phosphorylation and activation of type I receptors, which, in turn, phosphorylate and activate a specific set of downstream signaling molecules called Smads. In general terms, TGF-&#x003b2;s bind to the TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (TGF&#x003b2;RII) and TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor (ALK5) activating TGF-&#x003b2; Smads (2 and 3), while BMPs bind to the BMP type II receptor and type I receptors ALK2, -3, or 6, activating BMP Smads (1, 5 and 8). However, it is likely that these signaling interactions are more complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, possibly allowing formation of heterotetrameric complexes composed of different type II and type I receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, recent studies have identified novel TGF-&#x003b2;-related ligands, which can bind to entire different combinations of receptors. For instance, growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) 8 and 9 can bind to Activin type II receptor and ALK5 to activate TGF-&#x003b2; Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <italic>Alk5 </italic>in a specific cell lineage should reveal phenotypes which cannot be seen in comparable mutants lacking <italic>Tgfbr2</italic>. Indeed, we recently showed that neural crest cell specific <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants display a unique spectrum of craniofacial developmental defects, e.g., cleft snout and severe mandibular hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; these phenotypes were not seen in corresponding <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To determine, whether ALK5 would also mediate unique non-redundant signaling events in cardiac neural crest cells, we focused on cardiac and pharyngeal phenotypes of mouse embryos lacking <italic>Alk5 </italic>specifically in neural crest cells. We discovered that in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants, pharyngeal organs (thymus and parathyroid) fail to migrate appropriately. Moreover, the mutant embryos display severe aortic sac and pharyngeal arch artery defects, and failed aortico-pulmonary septation leading to PTA. Our data further suggest that at least some of these abnormal detected phenotypes result from a dramatic increase in apoptosis of postmigratory cardiac neural crest cells. These phenotypes differ remarkably from those seen in corresponding <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mutants, suggesting that ALK5 mediates a wider spectrum of signaling events than its classical binding partner TGF&#x003b2;RII in cardiac neural crest cells during cardiac and pharyngeal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Persistent truncus arteriosus and abnormal large vessels in mice lacking <italic>Alk5 </italic>in cardiac NCCs</title><p>To inactivate <italic>Alk5 </italic>in cardiac NCCs, mice homozygous for the <italic>floxed Alk5 </italic>allele (<italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic>/<italic>Flox</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] were crossed with transgenic <italic>Wnt1-Cre </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which were also heterozygous for the <italic>Alk5 </italic>knockout allele (<italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup>) allele. The resulting mice heterozygous for the <italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>Flox </italic></sup>and <italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>KO </italic></sup>alleles, which also carried the <italic>Wnt1-Cre </italic>transgene, had the <italic>Alk5 </italic>gene specifically inactivated in NCCs (herein termed <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre</italic>), while the littermates with remaining allelic combinations were phenotypically normal and served as controls (<italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic>/+</sup><italic>, Alk5</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic>/+</sup><italic>; Wnt1-Cre</italic>). When embryos were harvested during the last day of gestation, an expected number (25%) of <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants were recovered. However, all mutant offspring died either during the birth or during the first post-natal hours.</p><p>To determine, if ALK5-mediated TGF-&#x003b2;-signaling had a role in development of the OFT and large vessels of the aortic arch, we performed casting dye experiments on E17 embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;D</xref>). In wild-type embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), the aorta was clearly separated from the pulmonary trunk, and the right brachiocephalic, left carotid and left subclavian arteries branched directly off the aortic arch. In contrast, <italic>Alk5/Wnt1Cre </italic>mutant embryos consistently displayed a single prominent arterial trunk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;D</xref>), while corresponding <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) displayed interrupted aortic arch, as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Approximately 40% of the <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants had a right-sided outflow tract, with the retroesophageal arch connecting to the descending aorta and to the left subclavian artery. The carotid arteries originated either from a common bud located in the ventral side of the ascending arch, or from separate adjacent sites, as verified by serial sectioning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M&#x02013;P</xref>). The remaining mutants displayed a left-sided aortic arch, where the right carotid arteries originated from the right lateral aspect of the ascending trunk, while the left carotid arteries budded from the ventral or right ventral aspects of the trunk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I&#x02013;L</xref>). Both right and left subclavian arteries consistently originated from the descending part of the aortic arch. Similarly, in all mutants both left and right pulmonary arteries always branched out from the common arterial trunk. To conclude, <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants consistently displayed PTA, which differed significantly from the characteristic interrupted aortic arch phenotype seen in <italic>Tgfbr2/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Abrogation of <italic>Alk5 </italic>in neural crest cells leads to persistent truncus arteriosus type A2</bold>.

To determine, whether ALK5-mediated signaling was involved in remodeling of PAAs, we performed intracardiac India ink injections at different developmental stages. While at E10, <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants did not show obvious differences in the PAAs, abnormal remodeling became obvious in mutants a day later at E11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The controls displayed the well-formed 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs. Moreover, the carotid duct (the dorsal aorta between the 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>PAAs) was already regressing as demonstrated by the reduced size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants, the 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>pairs of PAAs were bilaterally hypoplastic, whereas the 6<sup>th </sup>pair of PAAs was notably hyperplastic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, the carotid duct was remarkably large, when compared to controls. While the controls displayed an interruption of the carotid duct at E12 and E13 as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), the mutants demonstrated an uncharacteristic break of the dorsal aorta between the 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>pairs of PAAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Abnormal patterning of the PAAs in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants</bold>.

Subsequently, the right horn of this structure transforms into the prospective brachiocephalic artery, while the left horn together with the left 4<sup>th </sup>PAA gives rise to the definitive aortic arch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants, the T-shaped aortic sac failed to form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,D</xref>). Instead, the truncus bifurcated to a left and right arm, which further branched to the PAAs, particularly to the predominant pair of 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,D</xref>). The observed phenotype is consistent with the absence or severe hypoplasia of structures derived from the aortic sac in late stage embryos (E17), e.g., the missing brachiocephalic artery and severe shortening of the ascending truncus as shown in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Abnormal Aortic Sac in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants</bold>. <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants (B, D) fail to form the typical T-shaped structure of the aortic sac seen in controls at E11.5.

Briefly, <italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic>/<italic>Flox </italic></sup>mice were crossed with the <italic>ROSA26 Cre </italic>reporter mice, and subsequently <italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic>/<italic>Flox</italic></sup>;<italic>R26R</italic>(+/+) females were crossed with <italic>Alk5</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic>/<italic>WT</italic></sup><italic>;Wnt1-Cre </italic>males.

Staining of embryos for &#x003b2;-galactosidase at E8-E11 did not reveal detectable differences in NCC migration between mutants and controls (data not shown). Similarly, serial transverse sectioning of whole mount embryos (E10-E12) and subsequent analysis of positively stained cells in the OFT region demonstrated that CNCCs deficient in <italic>Alk5 </italic>were capable of populating the PAAs, aortic sac and conotruncal ridges at a level comparable to that of controls (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). To conclude, the observed phenotypes in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants were certainly not due to defective migration of CNCCs to the pharyngeal and outflow tract regions.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Normal cardiac NCC migration in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants</bold>.

Initially, the condensed mesenchyme derived from the NC forms in the base of the aortic sac between the origins of 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs. Subsequently, two prongs of the developing aortico-pulmonary (AP) septum extend into the truncal cushions and the aortico-pulmonary septation complex crosses the aortic sac cranially. In ink-injected control embryos at E11.5, a characteristic conotruncal transition separating the truncus and conus could be seen as a twisted configuration, resulting from a change in orientation of the truncal and conal cushions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants the outflow tract appeared unusually straight, failing to demonstrate the distinct conotruncal transition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,D</xref>). This assay also clearly showed a dramatic reduction in the size of the aortic sac. Histological analysis of control samples displayed the characteristic rotation of the aortic sac and truncal OFT at the level where the AP septation takes place and verified the presence of the distinctive condensed AP-septal mesenchyme, which gradually divided the OFT to the aorta and the pulmonary trunk (asterisks in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). <italic>R26R </italic>lineage tracing showed that this tissue is derived from the NC, while immunostaining for &#x003b1;-SMA showed differentiation into smooth muscle (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants the characteristic rotation of the aortic sac and truncal OFT fails to take place (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G&#x02013;L</xref>), and a properly formed AP-septum was not detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G,H</xref>). R26R lineage tracing demonstrated that the defects were not due to failure of NCCs to reach the OFT region. NC-derived cells around the abnomally bifurcated aortic sac, the abnormally large sixth PAAs and the truncus demonstrated strong &#x003b1;SMA staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H,J,L</xref>). Recently, we showed that the NC-specific mutants of the related type I receptor, <italic>Alk2</italic>, display PTA as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In <italic>Alk2/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants, the rotation of the aortic sac and truncal OFT failed to occur (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6M&#x02013;R</xref>) as seen in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants. However, in <italic>Alk2 </italic>mutants the 6<sup>th </sup>pair of the PAAs was grossly hypoplastic, and while the <italic>Alk2/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants displayed a noticeable amount of septal tissue between the 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6M,N</xref>), the condensed septal mesenchyme lacking <italic>Alk2 </italic>failed to extend the prongs into the truncal cushions and to form the AP septum. Concurrently, the 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs were losing their patency, which may have further contributed to the failed AP septation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6M,O,Q</xref>). While CNCCs managed to migrate to the aortic sac and the truncal cushion level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6N,P,R</xref>), immunostaining for &#x003b1;SMA appeared much weaker when compared to controls and <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants, implying that ALK2-mediated signaling is involved in smooth muscle cell differentiation as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To conclude, while both <italic>Alk2 </italic>and <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants demonstrate a failure in both the rotation of the aortic sac and the truncal OFT, and in the formation of the AP septum, the pathogenetic mechanisms behind these defects appear remarkably different.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The truncal OFT fails to rotate in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants</bold>.

To analyze whether this phenotype resulted either from defective CNCC proliferation or inappropriate apoptosis, we used BrdU and TUNEL staining, respectively. While CNCC proliferation was not affected in <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants (data not shown), we could detect a dramatic increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells in tissues surrounding the aortic sac including the site where the AP-septum forms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A&#x02013;C</xref>). Dual staining for <italic>lacZ </italic>and TUNEL positive cells demonstrated that these cells were postmigratory CNCCs; this phenotype was already clearly detectable at E10.5. These results were confirmed by using immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, another marker for apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I,J</xref>).

Normally the thymus develops from the third pharyngeal pouch endoderm and migrates caudally to its final location in the superior mediastinum as seen in controls at E14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>). In contrast, the thymic primordia of the <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutant littermates failed to descend caudally, and were located bilaterally in the neck region, where they were surrounded by neural crest-derived mesenchyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D,E</xref>). The fate determination assay demonstrated that the thymic primordia were equally populated by NCCs both in controls and <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B,E</xref>). Likewise the parathyroid glands failed to migrate normally in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants.

Using this approach, several studies have independently shown that the NC-specific deletion of the <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>gene leads to a distinct set of calvarial, facial and cardiac defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, these defects appear quite different both in the craniofacial and pharyngeal regions, including the heart, when compared to the corresponding mutants of <italic>Alk5</italic>, which encodes the TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor, a prototypical binding partner of TGF-&#x003b2;RII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the present study). While <italic>Tgfbr2/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants as well as mice deficient in <italic>Tgf-&#x003b2;2 </italic>display the PTA type A4 (truncus arteriosus with interrupted aortic arch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]), <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants reported here demonstrate earlier patterning defects of the PAAs, which is particularly obvious in the 3<sup>rd </sup>pair of the PAAs. Moreover, the <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants display an abnormal patterning of the aortic sac and defective AP septation leading to PTA, reminiscent of type A2 (= truncus artriosus with no main pulmonary artery segment present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). However, our results also demonstrate that significant hypoplasia of the aortic sac leads to a severe shortening of the ascending truncal arch, which masks possible defects in derivatives of the 4<sup>th </sup>PAAs, i.e., interruption of the aortic arch. These observed differences are likely due to substantial apoptosis of <italic>Alk5-</italic>deficient post-migratory neural crest cells, which is clearly detectable at E10.5, whereas similar intense cell death has not been reported in <italic>Tgfbr2/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our present results suggest that while TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in cardiac NCCs is predominantly mediated via the ALK5/TGF-&#x003b2;RII receptor complex, ALK5 also mediates signaling of other related ligands, which are either directly or indirectly required for appropriate NCC survival. In fact, it has been shown that, besides TGF-&#x003b2;RII, ALK5 can also form a complex with the Activin type IIB receptor to activate downstream Smads 2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, a subset of TGF-&#x003b2;-related growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), e.g., GDF8, GDF9, GDF11 and GDF15 could induce these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although relevant <italic>Gdfs 8, 9 11 </italic>and <italic>15 </italic>are not expressed in the developing heart, nor do the mice deficient in these <italic>Gdfs </italic>display developmental cardiac defects, we cannot exclude the possibility that circulating GDFs, perhaps in concert with TGF-&#x003b2;s may contribute to NCC survival during cardiac and pharyngeal morphogenesis.</p><p>We specifically studied apoptosis at the level of the aortic sac, where the AP-septum forms between the origins of 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>PAAs. Already at E10.5, we could see intense apoptosis among the postmigratory NCCs in the mesenchyme surrounding the aortic sac at the site where the prospective AP septum forms, i.e., this cell death precedes the AP septal defect seen in mutants. Although some NC-derived cells appeared to be differentiating to smooth muscle cells in the OFT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), we could never detect the AP septum forming in Alk5/Wnt1-Cre mutants between E10.5 and E11.5. These findings suggest that the pool of cells forming the AP septum is severely affected by the cell death. Moreover, it is likely that these cells forming the AP-septum die the before majority of them can differentiate to smooth muscle cells.</p><p>Several <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have suggested an indispensable role for TGF-&#x003b2;-signaling in differentiation of NCCs into smooth muscle cells. Moreover, a recent <italic>in vivo </italic>study suggested that mice lacking <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>in CNCCs display defective NCC differentiation into &#x003b1;SMA-positive cells in the AP septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although this result was later disputed by another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our immunohistochemical staining of &#x003b1;SMA in the OFT unequivocally demonstrated that signaling via ALK5 is not required for smooth muscle differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, it has been suggested that deletion of <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>in NCCs leads to other phenotypic features reminiscent of those seen in the velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCF/DGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] caused by a deletion of the so called DiGeorge critical region (<italic>DGCR</italic>) on chromosome 22q11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our present results suggest that although many of the observed phenotypes seen in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants superficially resemble those seen in VCF/DGS, a detailed examination shows that the NC-specific abrogation of <italic>Alk5 </italic>does not lead to VCF/DGS-like phenotypes. Firstly, while the pharyngeal organ migration fails in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants, perhaps as a result of increased mesenchymal cell death in the pharyngeal region, both the thymus, thyroid and parathyroid seem to develop relatively normally on the histological level in these mutants. Secondly, the NCC death seen in <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants affects a predominantly postmigratory population of NCCs, while genes located in the DGCR, i.e., <italic>Tbx1 </italic>and <italic>CrkL</italic>, control NCC survival earlier at E8.5-E10 by regulating proliferation of the secondary heart field (SHF), and endoderm expansion, which in turn provides survival signal for NCCs allowing them to populate the pharyngeal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>NCC ablation in the chick has been shown to lead to PTA and to a failure of addition of myocardium from the secondary heart field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It was suggested that the defective migration of cells from the secondary heart field to the OFT in turn resulted in shortening and inappropriate rotation of the OFT, leading to mal-alignment of the arterial pole with the ventricles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While the detected OFT phenotype in <italic>Alk5/Wnt1-Cre </italic>mutants shared many similarities with that seen in the chick NC ablation models, e.g., PTA and the hypoplastic aortic sac, our current results suggest that the secondary heart field is not severely affected in <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants (data not shown). Since we could not detect appropriate rotation of the OFT in neural crest-specific mutants of <italic>Alk5 </italic>or <italic>Alk2</italic>, it appears that cells derived from the NC, as well as those from the SHF, are mutually required for proper OFT rotation in mice. However, it appears that these two TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP type I receptors contribute to OFT rotation through different mechanisms. In Alk5 mutants there is very little, if any, detectable septal mesenchyme present, and thus it could be argued that in these mutants OFT rotation fails due to a lack of penetration of septal prongs into the cushion mesenchyme. In contrast, in <italic>Alk2/Wnt1</italic>-<italic>Cre </italic>mutants a sizeable septal mesenchyme could be seen, still without any obvious looping of the aortic sac and truncal OFT, suggesting that the mere presence of the septal mesenchyme, without correct smooth muscle cell differentiation, is not sufficient for OFT rotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have deleted the TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor (<italic>Alk5</italic>) gene specifically in the mouse neural crest (NC) cell lineage.

The cardiac and pharyngeal defects observed in the NC-specific <italic>Alk5 </italic>mutants differ significantly from those seen in corresponding mutants lacking the TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor, suggesting that signaling mediated by ALK5 is not limited to the classical TGF-&#x003b2; ligands during cardiac/pharyngeal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Alk5</italic>/<italic>Wnt1Cre </italic>mice</title><p><italic>Alk5 (</italic>and <italic>Alk2</italic>) mutant and control embryos were generated by mating Alk5<sup>ko/+</sup>(Alk2<sup>ko/+</sup>)/Wnt1-Cre male mice with females homozygous for the Alk5<sup>flox </sup>(Alk2<sup>flox</sup>) allele and the R26R reporter[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].
