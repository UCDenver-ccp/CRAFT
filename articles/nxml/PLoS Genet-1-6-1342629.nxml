					    Ablation of the Sam68 RNA Binding Protein Protects Mice from Age-Related Bone Loss
			</related-article>--><abstract><p>The Src substrate associated in mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68) is a KH-type RNA binding protein that has been shown to regulate several aspects of RNA metabolism; however, its physiologic role has remained elusive. Herein we report the generation of Sam68-null mice by homologous recombination. Aged Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice preserved their bone mass, in sharp contrast with 12-month-old wild-type littermates in which bone mass was decreased up to approximately 75&#x00025;. In fact, the bone volume of the 12-month-old Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was virtually indistinguishable from that of 4-month-old wild-type or Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow stromal cells had a differentiation advantage for the osteogenic pathway. Moreover, the knockdown of Sam68 using short hairpin RNA in the embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor C3H10T1/2 cells resulted in more pronounced expression of the mature osteoblast marker osteocalcin when differentiation was induced with bone morphogenetic protein-2. Cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts generated from Sam68<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates were induced to differentiate into adipocytes with culture medium containing pioglitazone and the Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts shown to have impaired adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, in vivo it was shown that sections of bone from 12-month-old Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had few marrow adipocytes compared with their age-matched wild-type littermate controls, which exhibited fatty bone marrow. Our findings identify endogenous Sam68 as a positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, which is consistent with Sam68 being a modulator of bone marrow mesenchymal cell differentiation, and hence bone metabolism, in aged mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Osteoporosis is a debilitating bone disease that is characterized by reduced bone mass and microarchitectural damage, which result in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Peak bone mass, which is achieved by the age of 30 in humans, has been identified as a major determinant of resistance or susceptibility to osteoporosis. The authors generated mice deficient for the Sam68 RNA binding protein, a protein of unknown physiologic function. The mice develop normally and are protected against bone loss during aging. Age-related bone loss has long been associated with an increase in marrow adipocytes, which are derived from the same mesenchymal lineage as osteoblasts in bone marrow. The authors showed that Sam68 regulates the differentiation of this mesenchymal lineage, such that in its absence, osteoblasts continued to be generated in aging bone, leading to preservation of bone mass. This study identifies a physiologic role for Sam68 as a modulator of the bone marrow stem cell niche and hence of bone metabolism. The data identify Sam68 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of age-related bone loss.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Richard S, Torabi N, Franco GV, Tremblay GA, Chen T, et al.

In the present paper, we report the generation of Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and analysis of their skeletal phenotype. Our data indicate that the absence of Sam68 confers resistance to age-related bone loss in mice such that old Sam68 have a higher bone mass than their wild-type littermates. We provide evidence that Sam68 regulates the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells by showing that cells isolated from Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals had enhanced osteogenic activity and decreased adipogenic activity than those harvested from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were impaired in their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, consistent with Sam68 being a regulator of bone marrow mesenchymal cell differentiation. These results also characterize a new animal model to study bone metabolism, regeneration, and repair during aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sam68 Is Expressed in the Developing Skeleton of Embryonic Mice</title><p>The Sam68 mRNA is known to be widely expressed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010074-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas its pattern of protein expression in vivo remains to be defined.

The wild-type littermates underwent age-related bone loss that occurs naturally in mammals, while the Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals preserved their bone mass with aging. The differentiation of bone marrow stem cells isolated from Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor cells C3H10T1/2 treated with Sam68 shRNA resulted in a more pronounced osteoblast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that the loss of Sam68 enhances osteoblast differentiation.

One explanation for this phenomenon is that Sam68 function is sub-served by one or more of its family members during development such as SLM-1 and SLM-2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010074-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

Traditional histology and histomorphometry suggested that the mechanism involved preservation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity. The documented role of the Sam68 regulatory protein, Src, in osteopetrosis led us to investigate the morphology and activity of Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> osteoclasts ex vivo. The Src tyrosine kinase was shown to play a role in bone remodeling when Src<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice died at 6 months of age with an osteopetrotic phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010074-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; and the defect was attributed to defective osteoclast function &#x0005b;55&#x02212;59&#x0005d;. We therefore cultured mature osteoclasts harvested from Sam68<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice ex vivo on dentin slices to quantify their resorptive capacity. The fact that Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> osteoclasts looked and acted like Sam68<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> osteoclasts ex vivo and in vivo made it unlikely that this was the primary source of the difference in bone metabolism in 12-month-old Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The fact that the CTX levels were lower in young and old Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggested that there is reduced bone resorption compared with wild-type littermate controls. However, this reduction in bone resorption occurred with normal osteoclast activity, as assessed by in vitro culturing. These observations are consistent with the Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice having a youth-like bone phenotype. However, it is still possible, that a mild impairment in Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice osteoclast function may manifest itself later in life in overall accumulation of bone and this will require further detailed studies.</p><p>Ex vivo differentiation of primary bone marrow stromal cells, harvested from Sam68<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, down the osteoblast lineage revealed an osteogenic advantage in the cultures of cells derived from the Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It will be important to demonstrate that a similar effect is observed using primary bone marrow stromal cells from aged Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Similar findings were observed when embryonic mesenchymal multipotential progenitor cells C3H10T1/2 treated with Sam68 shRNA, were differentiated into osteoblasts with BMP2.

These findings identify Sam68 as the first RNA binding protein to regulate mesenchymal cell differentiation and the challenge will be to identify the specific RNA targets that it regulates during this process.

The lowering of leptin levels in aged Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is consistent with these mice having a high bone mass compared with their aged littermates. These data would suggest that the leptin-sympathetic pathway is unaltered in Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and that the lowering of leptin may explain the lower levels of CTX in the serum of Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These findings suggest that Sam68 may be regulating bone metabolism at two different levels: (1) the absence of Sam68 results in lower leptin levels that may reduce bone resorption via the sympathetic nervous system and (2) the absence of Sam68 favors osteoblast, rather than adipocyte, differentiation.</p><p>In conclusion, our data define a physiologic role for Sam68 in bone metabolism and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. The bone phenotype observed in Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice imply that inhibitors of Sam68 could prevent age-related bone loss. Furthermore, the results also suggest that Sam68 expression levels, hypomorphism, and mutations in humans may influence susceptibility to marrow adipocyte accumulation and osteoporosis. Our findings also identify a new animal model to study aging bone loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Histologic, immunohistochemical, and histomorphometric analyses.</title><p>All analyses were performed essentially as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010074-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010074-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;.

XbaI-digested Sam68 genomic DNA fragments of 4 kb (encompassing exon 4 and part of exon 5) and 3kb (spanning part of exon 5 and exon 6) were subcloned in Bluescript SK resulting in pBS4 and pBS3, respectively. A DNA fragment was amplified from pBS4 with the following oligonucleotides (5&#x02032;-AAT GTC TAG AAA CAA CTC ATA TAC AGA C-3&#x02032;) and the universal primer. The XbaI-digested 1-kb DNA fragment was subcloned in the XbaI site of pPNT (a gift from Andrew Karaplis, McGill University, Montr&#x000e9;al, Quebec, Canada). The 3-kb fragment from pBS3 was amplified by PCR with (5&#x02032;-GGG ATG CGG CCG CTC TAG AAT TGT CCT ACT TGA ACG G-3') and (5&#x02032;-CGG TGG CGG CCG CTG TCG ACC TGA GTA ACA TTT CTT A-3&#x02032;) and subcloned in the NotI site of pPNT. The targeting vector pPNT-Sam68 replaces exon 4 and part of exon 5 with a neomycin-resistant gene cassette. An SalI site was introduced at the 3&#x02032; end of the 3-kb DNA fragment and was used to linearize the plasmid for electroporation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Approximately 1,000 ES colonies were screened and two clones were identified that contained the Sam68 mutant allele, as determined by Southern blotting. Targeted ES cells were injected into 3.5-day-old BALB/c blastocysts and were transferred into CD-1 foster mothers, and animals classified as chimeras by coat color were mated with BALB/c mice. Germ line transmission was achieved and the mice were maintained in C57BL/6 background. The mice used for this study represent mice that were backcrossed in C57BL/6 between three and eight generations; in addition, we maintained the mice in the 129/SvJ strain and observed a similar phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Genotyping and immunoblot analyses.</title><p>All mouse procedures were performed in accordance with McGill University guidelines, which are set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
