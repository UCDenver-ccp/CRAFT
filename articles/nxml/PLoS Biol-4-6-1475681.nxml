The testis and ovary represent two divergent pathways of development from the bipotential embryonic gonad. The switch that initiates divergent development of the gonad is highly diverse among species; however, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the establishment of ovary or testis pathways are likely to be conserved. In all species, the embryonic gonad is made up of a mixed population of germ cells and somatic cells. This tissue is remarkable in that all of its cells are believed to be bipotential, and can differentiate into ovarian or testicular lineages &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two developmental pathways, some of the genes that are involved in establishing sexual dimorphism, including 
				<italic>Dax1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1), Sox9 (Sry-like HMG box 9), Fgf9 (fibroblast growth factor 9),</italic> and

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The conventional view of mammalian sex determination is that the basic pathway of organ development is ovarian, and that the testis-determining gene operates by diverting this program toward testis development by simultaneously influencing the fate of the key supporting cell lineage and initiating a male-specific morphogenetic program. All of the experimental evidence suggests that these two processes are closely interwoven. For example, both proliferation &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and migration of cells to trigger testis cord formation &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In the absence of 
				<italic>Sry</italic> expression&#x02014;in XX embryos, or in XY embryos carrying a deletion of 
				<italic>Sry</italic>&#x02014;cells in the gonad follow an ovarian differentiation pathway. Genetic evidence from chimeric mice &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, indicate that 
				<italic>Sry</italic> expression is required only in precursors of the somatic supporting cell lineage. Expression of 
				<italic>Sry</italic> in these bipotential cells leads to their differentiation as testis-specific Sertoli cells rather than as follicle cells, the parallel cell type of the ovary &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. It is believed that the Sertoli cell is the first cell type to differentiate in the gonad &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. There is substantial evidence that a critical threshold number of Sertoli cells is required to establish testis differentiation &#x0005b;

			</p><p>Once 
				<italic>Sry</italic> expression begins, expression patterns of other genes in the gonad begin to diverge. The first gene downstream of 
				<italic>Sry</italic> known to show male-specific up-regulation in Sertoli cell precursors is a related gene expressed in many tissues in the developing embryo
				<italic>, Sox9</italic>. Disruption of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> expression in the XY gonad causes male-to-female sex reversal &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. These studies indicate that 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> plays a central role in sex determination. Unlike 
				<italic>Sry,</italic> which is specific to mammals, expression of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> is known to be conserved in the gonad of many species. In mammals, 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> is up-regulated immediately after 
				<italic>Sry</italic> expression initiates. Experiments tracing 
				<italic>Sry-</italic>expressing cells using a stable reporter demonstrated that once testis differentiation is established, all Sertoli cells that express 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> are descendants of cells that have expressed 
				<italic>Sry</italic> &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that activation of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> is a cell-autonomous effect of 
				<italic>Sry</italic>. However, mutations in several signaling pathways including 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic> and 
				<italic>Igf1r/Irr/Ir (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor-related receptor/insulin receptor)</italic> resulted in loss of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> expression and partial or complete sex reversal &#x0005b;

			</p><p>Mice homozygous for a null mutation in

				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> like many of the founding signals in the gonads, is initially expressed in gonads of both sexes, but becomes male-specific after 
				<italic>Sry</italic> is expressed. In a reciprocal manner, expression of 
				<italic>Wnt4,</italic> which is also initially common to gonads of both sexes, becomes female-specific &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. XX gonads with a null mutation in 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> display some obvious aspects of testicular differentiation &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Based on the theory that Sertoli cells initiate all downstream testicular differentiation, this might imply that Sertoli differentiation had been initiated in 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> XX gonads. However, expression of Sertoli cell markers was not previously detected in these mutants during fetal stages &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, leading to the conclusion that 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> was not involved in primary sex determination in the gonad.
			</p><p>To integrate these findings, we investigated the genetic relationship of 
				<italic>Sry, Sox9, Fgf9,</italic> and 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> in the regulatory network that governs the gonadal field. We show that the loss of 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic> in homozygous mutant XY gonads does not affect the expression of SRY or the initial up-regulation of SOX9; however, SOX9 expression is not maintained in the 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant gonads, and testis differentiation is aborted. We also demonstrate that FGF9 represses the ovary-promoting gene, 
				<italic>Wnt4.</italic> We hypothesize that FGF9 functions in a feed-forward loop to expand Sertoli precursor cells, which secrete FGF9, to a critical threshold number sufficient to suppress 
				<italic>Wnt4.</italic> This directly or indirectly stabilizes SOX9 expression and secures the male fate of the gonad. WNT4 seems to oppose the male pathway by repressing expression of SOX9 and FGF9. Surprisingly, both male pathway genes are transiently activated in 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> XX gonads in the absence of the Y-linked gene 
				<italic>Sry</italic>. Based on this genetic and in vitro data, we suggest that the plasticity of the bipotential gonad is controlled by mutually antagonistic signals between FGF9 and WNT4 in the gonadal field. These signals coordinate sexually dimorphic patterns of growth, morphogenesis, and cellular differentiation.

To test the local effect of FGF9, we modified the XX gonad culture by stably immobilizing FGF9, or BSA as a control, on beads (

				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> suggesting that FGF9 is not necessary for this step. However, FGF9 may act to trigger cell proliferation, increasing the number of Sertoli precursors above a threshold needed to stabilize the male pathway, consistent with threshold requirements deduced from earlier studies using XX&#x02194;XY chimeric gonads &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Since Sertoli cells produce FGF9, loss of proliferation of Sertoli precursors may result in a reduction of the overall level of FGF9, and/or other male paracrine signals, below a critical threshold level required to antagonize the influence of WNT4. This model is appealing, because it links cell proliferation, believed to be required for establishment of the male pathway &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, with Sertoli fate determination. A recent study by Yoshioka et al. &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; showed that misexpression of 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic> in chick nephrogenous mesenchyme led to the expansion of gonadal marker gene expression, implicating 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic> in gonadal cell proliferation across species.
			</p><p>It has been suggested that SOX9 represses WNT4 based on misexpression studies &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we show that the addition of FGF9 protein to XX gonad explant cultures repressed the expression of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>. Down-regulation of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> is unlikely to occur through SOX9, as SOX9 is not up-regulated in this situation &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, although both SRY and SOX9 are initially expressed in 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> XY gonads, 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> is not down-regulated in the absence of 
				<italic>Fgf9</italic> (
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040187-g004">Figure 4</xref>K). These findings support the idea that FGF9 acts as the antagonist of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>. Antagonism of WNT signals may be a multistep process involving both the transcriptional down-regulation of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> observed in this study and the destabilization of downstream Wnt intracellular pathways that antagonize SOX9 expression, as shown in chondrocyte differentiation &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, or that compete for intracellular signal transducers as has been reported in other systems &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b050">50</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Future work will address these possibilities.
			</p><p>In support of the idea that 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> antagonizes the male pathway, we found that the loss of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> caused the up-regulation of both SOX9 and FGF9 in XX gonads where 
				<italic>Sry</italic> is absent. It appears that the male pathway can be initiated by disrupting the balance between 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> and 
				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> a finding that has strong implications for other vertebrate sex-determination systems in which 
				<italic>Sry</italic> is not the sex determining factor. However, up-regulation of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> is not sufficient to establish testis development in this mutant, as occurs in 
				<italic>Odsex</italic> and other gain-of-function mutants where 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> is misexpressed in the XX gonad &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b024">24</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In those two misexpression cases, 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> expression may have been artificially sustained by exogenous regulatory sequences that bypass the fine dosage balance in this signaling network.
			</p><p>In 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> mutants, SOX9 expression is not maintained. In light of the observation that the 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> XX gonad does not increase significantly in size (
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040187-g006">Figure 6</xref>), it is possible that the FGF9/SOX9-expressing population did not reach a critical threshold. Alternatively (or in addition), another male-specific factor normally dependent on 
				<italic>Sry</italic> may be required to sustain SOX9 expression, possibly FGF-binding proteins in the extracellular matrix or FGF receptors. It is equally plausible that there are other female-specific factors that antagonize the establishment of SOX9 expression. It has been observed that several other WNTs are expressed in the XX gonad &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, and these or other factors may partially compensate for the loss of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>.
			</p><p>These findings suggest that WNT4 signaling normally acts as a repressor of the male pathway by interfering with the up-regulation of SOX9 expression. One report of a duplication of the region of human Chromosome 1, which includes 
				<italic>WNT4,</italic> led to an intersex phenotype &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the report constitutes only circumstantial evidence. Such a role is not supported by efforts to misexpress 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic> in XY gonads, which have led to very mild phenotypes with no evidence for defects in Sertoli cell differentiation &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040187-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that WNT4 protein did not function as an active signal in these transgenic mice, either because it was not expressed in the right cells, at the right time, or at the right level. Consistent with our data and the partially sex-reversed phenotype of 
				<italic>Wnt4</italic>
				<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> XX mutants, other WNTs or additional female factors may be required.
			</p><p>The switch that controls sex determination is biologically diverse. 
				<italic>Sry</italic> is not present in nonmammalian systems; however, antagonistic signaling between FGFs and WNTs may be the conserved mechanism that balances the gonad between testicular and ovarian fates in vertebrates. In theory, any genetic or environmental switch may tip the balance toward the male pathway. Based on our findings we propose that cells in the mammalian gonad are balanced between two competing cell fates by counterbalanced signaling pathways, 
				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> expressed near the coelomic surface, and 
				<italic>Wnt4,</italic> expressed near the mesonephric border (
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040187-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In mammalian XY gonads, the onset of 
				<italic>Sry</italic> expression initiates the male pathway by up-regulating 
				<italic>Sox9</italic>. SOX9 up-regulates 
				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> which initiates a 
				<italic>Sox9/Fgf9</italic> feed-forward loop that accelerates commitment to the male pathway. In XX gonads or XY mutant gonads lacking 
				<italic>Sry, Sox9,</italic> or 
				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> the SOX9/FGF9 feed-forward loop is not established, and WNT4 gains control of the gonadal field. This results in the down-regulation of 
				<italic>Sox9</italic> and 
				<italic>Fgf9,</italic> tilting the balance toward commitment to the female pathway. Further experiments will be required to define the molecular mechanism of FGF9 and WNT4 action. However, our in vivo and in vitro data strongly support the antagonistic relationship of these two signaling pathways in regulating expression of the testis-determining factor SOX9.

In the absence of a feed-forward loop between SOX9 and FGF9 (e.g., in XX gonads), WNT4 blocks
