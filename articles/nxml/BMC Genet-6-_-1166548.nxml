The intestines of <italic>Cftr </italic>deficient mice (CF mice: Cftr<sup><italic>tm</italic>1<italic>Unc</italic></sup>) are prone to obstruction by excessive mucus accumulation and are used as a model of meconium ileus and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. This phenotype is strongly dependent on the genetic background of the mice. On the C57Bl/6 background, the majority of CF mice cannot survive on solid mouse chow, have inflammation of the small intestine, and are about 30% smaller than wild type littermates. In this work potential modifier loci of the CF intestinal phenotype were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CF mice on a mixed genetic background (95% C57Bl/6 and 5% 129Sv) were compared to CF mice congenic on the C57Bl/6 background for several parameters of the intestinal CF phenotype. CF mice on the mixed background exhibit significantly greater survival when fed dry mouse chow, have reduced intestinal inflammation as measured by quantitative RT-PCR for marker genes, have near normal body weight gain, and have reduced mucus accumulation in the intestinal crypts. There was an indication of a gender effect for body weight gain: males did not show a significant improvement at 4 weeks of age, but were of normal weight at 8 weeks, while females showed improvement at both 4 and 8 weeks. By a preliminary genome-wide PCR allele scanning, three regions were found to be potentially associated with the milder phenotype. One on chr.1, defined by marker D1Mit36, one on chr. 9 defined by marker D9Mit90, and one on chr. 10, defined by marker D10Mit14.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Potential modifier regions were found that have a positive impact on the inflammatory phenotype of the CF mouse small intestine and animal survival. Identification of polymorphisms in specific genes in these regions should provide important new information about genetic modifiers of the CF intestinal phenotype.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<italic>CFTR</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Different mutations have a range of effects on the levels of CFTR protein and its proper functioning in epithelial transport of Cl<sup>- </sup>and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The severity of the pancreatic phenotype in human CF is well correlated with the extent of impaired CFTR function caused by specific mutations. Loss of CFTR function results in destruction of the exocrine tissue and eventual pancreatic insufficiency. On the other hand, the effects of CF on organs including the airways and intestines is less well correlated with specific <italic>CFTR </italic>mutations and their effects on CFTR protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This indicates that other genes are likely to be important as modifiers of the CF phenotype.</p><p>With the exception of pancreatic insufficiency resulting in impaired digestion, other aspects of CF are less readily related to loss of CFTR function. Nutritional problems can persist even with adequate oral enzyme supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and neutralization of gastric acid to improve lipase function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and may involve both impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Inadequate absorption or assimilation of nutrients appears to be of greater importance because even with adequate oral enzyme supplementation nutrition is rarely fully corrected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is also excessive mucus accumulation in the CF intestine, and inappropriate inflammation is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mucus is involved in obstruction of the gut which occurs frequently in CF infants (called meconium ileus, MI) and adults (called distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, DIOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. And, similar to CF airways, there is also an inflammation of the CF intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These changes are less directly related to specific mutations in the <italic>CFTR </italic>gene and are likely related to other differences in individual genetic makeup.</p><p>Previous work using human patients and genetically altered mice has identified some modifier genes and have advanced our understanding of CF pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In one study using CF mice on different genetic backgrounds, a region on mouse chromosome 7 was shown to ameliorate intestinal blockage and the effect was in part due to a calcium-regulated Cl-channel which compensated for loss of CFTR function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Marker haplotypes of the syntenic region of human chromosome 19q13 were also shown to be associated with the risk of MI in CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In other work, a region on mouse chr. 6 was strongly associated with lung inflammation, consisting of mononuclear cell interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in CF mouse airways; and other loci on chr. 1, 2, 10, and 17 were also linked to the airway phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In this work, CF mice on a mixed strain background were found to have a less severe CF phenotype compared to CF mice congenic on the C57Bl/6 background. There were no differences in the pancreatic phenotype comparing CF mice on the different backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, mice on the mixed background seemed more robust than CF mice on the B6 background which prompted us to characterize them in greater detail. Genome wide allele scanning was used to begin identification of regions associated with the less severe intestinal phenotype. Future identification of specific genes should further our understanding of the complex intestinal CF phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>CF mice on the mixed background have improved body weight gain</title><p>Body mass was recorded for male and female mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age. On the B6 background, female and male mice are about 30% smaller than wild type mice at both 4 and 8 weeks of age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). By comparison, female CF mice on the mixed background were not significantly smaller than wild type mice at 4 weeks of age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The improved body weight of female CF mice on the mixed background was maintained at 8 weeks of age. Male CF mice on the mixed background at 4 weeks of age were significantly smaller than wild type and not significantly larger than CF mice congenic on the B6 background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). By 8 weeks of age, CF males on the mixed background were 12% smaller but this was not significantly different compared to wild type mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Effect of genetic background on body weights of CF mice</italic>.

To determine whether the mixed genetic background affected expression of inflammatory marker genes, quantitative, real-time RT-PCR was used to measure gene expression. Expression of the following genes was compared in wild type and CF mice on the different genetic backgrounds. Mast cell protease 2 (<italic>Mcpt2</italic>) is a marker of differentiated mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and mast cells are more abundant in the B6 CF mouse intestine. Leucine-rich &#x003b1;2 glycoprotein (<italic>Lrg1</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) is a marker of differentiating neutrophils, which are more numerous in the B6 CF mouse intestine. The same gene is also known as leucine-rich high endothelial cell glycoprotein (<italic>Lrhg</italic>) and has been shown to be a marker of high endothelial venules (HEV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] which increase in tissues during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Hematopoietic cell transcript 1 (<italic>HemT1</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) is a marker of blood cell proliferation and its expression is strongly elevated in the B6 CF mouse small intestine. Serum amyloid A3 (<italic>SAA3</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) is an acute phase gene and its expression in villus epithelial cells is increased in the B6 CF intestine. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (<italic>SOCS3</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) is an anti-inflammatory gene that interacts with the JAK-STAT pathway and its expression in increased in the B6 CF intestine. <italic>Muclin </italic>(also known as <italic>dmbt1</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) expression is upregulated in the B6 CF intestine; it is a cell surface glycoprotein postulated to be an epithelial protective molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with previous results, <italic>Mcpt2 </italic>was increased in CF mice on the B6 background by over 9-fold compared to wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). By contrast, there was not a significant difference in <italic>Mcpt2 </italic>expression between CF and wild type on the mixed background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). <italic>Lrg1/Lrhg </italic>expression was increased more than 20-fold in CF mice on the B6 background compared to wild type, but there was no significant difference between CF and wild type on the mixed background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). <italic>SAA3 </italic>mRNA was about 3.5-fold increased in CF mice on the B6 background, but was not significantly different compared to wild type on the mixed background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). <italic>SOCS3 </italic>was more than 2-fold increased in CF mice on the B6 background compared to wild type, and on the mixed background was only 1.5-fold greater than wild type, and the difference was not significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). <italic>Muclin </italic>is overexpressed almost 3-fold in the CF intestine on the B6 background, but on the mixed background the expression level in CF mice was not significantly different than wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Finally, <italic>HemT1 </italic>was overexpressed almost 20-fold in B6 CF mice compared to wild type, and on the mixed background the CF expression level was not statistically different from wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>Effect of genetic background on inflammatory gene expression in CF mouse small intestine</italic>.

With the limited number of animals, there was also no evidence for imprinting.</p></sec><sec><title>CF mice on the mixed background have less intestinal mucus accumulation</title><p>The most striking histological difference in the CF mouse small intestine is the accumulation of mucus in intestinal crypts which is associated with the lethal obstruction that results in death of these mice on a standard solid chow diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Using periodic acid Schiff's staining for neutral mucins, histological analysis of small intestine tissues was performed. The wild type small intestine on both the B6 and the mixed genetic backgrounds were similar. The intestinal crypts were very small with only traces of PAS-reactivity in the lumen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, respectively). The surfaces of the villus epithelium were moderately stained and goblet cells were strongly stained in the wild type tissues. In contrast, the intestine of CF mice on the B6 genetic background exhibited greatly dilated crypts filled with PAS-reactive mucus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). CF mice on the mixed background had less mucus accumulation than CF mice on the B6 background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D-F</xref>). The amount of mucus in CF mice on the mixed background was variable from mouse to mouse. In some mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), only occasional crypts had accumulated mucus and the crypt lumina were not very dilated. In some mice there was more mucus in the crypts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), while others had moderate mucus accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). A total of six CF mice on the mixed background were examined histologically, and three had little mucus, one had some mucus, and two had moderate amounts of mucus. Despite the variability, all the CF mice on the mixed background had less crypt dilation and less mucus accumulation compared to CF mice on the B6 background.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><italic>Histological appearance of the small intestine of wild type and CF mice on the different genetic backgrounds</italic>.

(B) In the CF tissue on the B6 background, the crypt lumina are greatly dilated and filled with PAS-reactive mucus (arrows). In some CF mice on the mixed background, the crypts are not apparently different than wild type (D), and the crypts are normal appearing (arrows). Some CF mice on the mixed background had mildly affected crypts (E), while others had greater crypt dilation and mucus accumulation (F). Overall, the CF mice on the mixed background were less severely affected compared to those on the B6 background.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-6-29-3"/></fig><p>Thus, it appears that whatever the nature of the genetic differences between the two background strains, they affect secretion and accumulation of mucus in the CF small intestine. To determine if the difference could be accounted for by altered mucin gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression of the intestinal goblet cell mucin gene, <italic>Muc2</italic>. In wild type intestine, B6 mice had 0.079 +/- 0.024 copies of <italic>Muc2/GAPDH </italic>(n = 8), and on the mixed background the level was 0.077 +/- 0.012 (n = 11). CF mice on the B6 background had 0.059 +/- 0.024 copies of <italic>Muc2 </italic>mRNA per <italic>GAPDH </italic>(n = 11), and on the mixed background the level was 0.056 +/- 0.010 (n = 11). Despite the increased mucus accumulation in CF, there is a slight decrease in <italic>Muc2 </italic>mRNA in the CF small intestine (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the milder CF phenotype on the mixed background, which includes less mucus accumulation, does not involve decreased mucin gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>CF mice on the mixed background have improved survival</title><p>As reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the expected number of <italic>Cftr </italic>null mice on the B6 background that survived to weaning was significantly less than that expected from Mendelian genetics (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

None of the known chloride channels that might substitute for the missing CFTR are in the regions of the three chromosomes associated with the milder phenotype. There are several potassium channel genes in the identified regions that potentially could affect electrolyte and fluid transport: <italic>Kcnj9 </italic>(chr.1, 94.2 cM), <italic>Kcnj10 </italic>(chr.1, 93.5 cM), <italic>Kcnj5 </italic>(chr.9, 11 cM), and <italic>Kcnc2 </italic>(chr.10, 62 cM).

Because the CF mouse intestinal phenotype is characterized by an innate type immune response, with increases in mast cells and neutrophils, the genes that affect these cells are of special interest. The <italic>Kitl </italic>gene is crucial for differentiation of mast cells, and CF mice on the mixed background have much fewer mature mast cells than on the B6 background as revealed by less expression of <italic>Mcpt2</italic>. Similarly, for neutrophils the selectins and Icam1 are of interest, as these proteins are required for extravasation of neutrophils from the circulation into the inflamed tissue.</p><p>Altered immune responses may also relate to excessive mucus accumulation in the CF intestine. It is unclear why mucus accumulates to high levels in CF tissues. In part it may be due to reduced fluid secretion and a more acidic environment in the lumina of affected organs. However, there is also evidence for hypersecretion of mucus in CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and it is likely that effector molecules released by mast cells and neutrophils (histamine, proteases, prostaglandins) have an important role in stimulating mucus secretion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work demonstrated that the CF inflammatory phenotype is much less severe in mice with a small contribution of 129/Sv alleles. A preliminary analysis identified regions on chr.1, 9, and 10 are that are potentially associated with the milder phenotype. Because of the inflammation of the CF small intestine, and the possible effects of immune cells on mucus secretion, the genes in the identified regions which are involved in mast cell and neutrophil differentiation and behavior are of special interest as potential CF modifiers. Future work should focus on narrowing down these regions and determining if there are polymorphisms that affect expression of specific genes that make the CF intestinal phenotype less severe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type and <italic>Cftr </italic>null mice on two different genetic backgrounds were used in this study. One group was congenic on the C57Bl/6 (B6) background, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The other group was on a mixed background of about 95% B6 and 5% 129/Sv (129). The mice on the mixed background originated as part of a recently published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] as follows. Mice carrying a targeted mutation of the <italic>gastrin </italic>gene on a mixed B6/129 background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] were bred for eight generations onto the B6 background. The <italic>gastrin</italic>(+/-) mice were then crossed for six generations with <italic>Cftr</italic>(+/-) mice congenic on the B6 background. A genome scan at this point showed that the mice were about 95% B6 and 5% 129 (see below). These mice were bred to obtain mice wild type for both <italic>gastrin </italic>alleles and either <italic>Cftr </italic>homozygous wild type [<italic>Cftr</italic>(+/+)] or <italic>Cftr </italic>homozygous null [<italic>Cftr</italic>(-/-)].</p><p>Mice were genotyped at 2 weeks of age by PCR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Unless otherwise stated, mice were maintained on a complete elemental liquid diet (Peptamen; Nestle Deerfield, IL) to prevent intestinal obstruction that occurs in CF mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Wild type littermates were maintained on the same diet. In some experiments, 8 week old mice were transferred onto solid mouse chow instead of Peptamen, and survival was recorded. Mice with apparent distress were sacrificed and survival on chow was recorded as the following day. Male and female mice were used at 6&#x02013;16 weeks of age. Mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility in barrier-top cages. All procedures were approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center IACUC.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic background determination</title><p>The Genome Scanning Service of The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) was used to determine the contributions of C57Bl/6 and 129/Sv strains in the interbred mice. Pieces of mouse tail were sent to The Jackson Laboratory for simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) PCR analysis with the DMit primers specific for B6 and 129 strain alleles <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org"/>. The SSLP panel consists of 108 mapped markers designed to distinguish between B6 and 129 strains.

Values were normalized to <italic>GAPDH </italic>mRNA and expression of this housekeeping gene is not altered in the CF mouse small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].
