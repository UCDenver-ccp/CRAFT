Furthermore, it serves a vital function in embryonic liver development. However, targeted deletion of <italic>Mtf1</italic> in the liver after birth is no longer lethal. For this study, <italic>Mtf1</italic> conditional knockout mice and control littermates were both mock- or cadmium-treated and liver-specific transcription was analyzed. Besides the well-characterized metallothionein genes, several new MTF-1 target genes with MRE motifs in the promoter region emerged. MTF-1 is required for the basal expression of selenoprotein W, muscle 1 gene (<italic>Sepw1</italic>) that encodes a glutathione-binding and putative antioxidant protein, supporting a role of MTF-1 in the oxidative stress response. Furthermore, MTF-1 mediates the cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (<italic>Ndrg1</italic>), which is induced by several stress conditions and is overexpressed in many cancers. MTF-1 is also involved in the cadmium response of cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 gene (<italic>Csrp1</italic>), which is implicated in cytoskeletal organization. In contrast, MTF-1 represses the basal expression of <italic>Slc39a10</italic>, a putative zinc transporter. In a pathway independent of MTF-1, cadmium also induced the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis and regeneration of glutathione, a cadmium-binding antioxidant. These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense, one via MTF-1 and its target genes, notably metallothioneins, the other via glutathione, with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>All organisms have evolved mechanisms to cope with a variety of stress situations. One type of stress response is triggered by heavy metals, such as zinc, copper and cadmium (for convenience, the terms zinc, copper and cadmium are also used here to denote Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, respectively). Metallothioneins (MTs), small, cysteine-rich proteins, play an important role in metal homeostasis and detoxification due to their ability to bind different heavy metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In the mouse, there are four metallothionein genes, designated as <italic>Mt1</italic> to <italic>Mt4</italic>. Basal, as well as heavy metal-induced, expression of <italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic> is mediated by metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This zinc finger protein recognizes short <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequences, termed metal response elements (MREs; core consensus sequence TGCRCNC), which are present in the promoters of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). MTF-1 is conserved in evolution, and homologs have been characterized in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>The role of MTF-1 has been studied most extensively in the mouse. Besides coping with heavy metal load, MTF-1 can also mediate the induction of <italic>Mt</italic> genes in response to other stress situations, such as oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition, it is required for the metalloregulation of <italic>Znt1</italic>, encoding the major plasma membrane-localized zinc efflux transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), the hypoxic/anoxic induction of the gene for placental growth factor (<italic>Plgf</italic>), an angiogenic protein of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), and has recently been invoked in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Furthermore, MTF-1 has an essential function during embryogenesis: targeted disruption of <italic>Mtf1</italic> results in embryonic lethality around 14 days <italic>post coitum</italic> due to hepatocyte necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In contrast, mice with null mutations for the stress-inducible metallothionein genes (<italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic>) are viable, though sensitive to cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), indicating that additional important MTF-1 target genes are involved in the lethal phenotype. With the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> conditional knockout technique, it is possible to circumvent the embryonic lethal phenotype of conventional <italic>Mtf1</italic> knockout mice. Previous experiments with this technique revealed that deletion of <italic>Mtf1</italic> from the liver after birth is no longer lethal under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>For this study, an inducible, liver-specific <italic>Mtf1</italic> knockout mouse line was generated to perform a search for MTF-1 target genes and cadmium-inducible genes in the adult liver. A number of target gene candidates emerged upon a transcriptome analysis of mock- and cadmium-treated <italic>Mtf1</italic> conditional knockout mice and control littermates and several of these were confirmed by semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. Besides the stress-inducible metallothionein genes that were already known as target genes of MTF-1, we find that MTF-1 is important for basal liver expression of the gene for selenoprotein W, muscle 1 (<italic>Sepw1</italic>) as well as for cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (<italic>Ndrg1</italic>) and the gene encoding cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 (<italic>Csrp1</italic>). In addition, MTF-1 appears to repress the expression of solute carrier family 39, member 10 gene (<italic>Slc39a10</italic>), which encodes a putative metal ion transporter. In an MTF-1-independent transcriptome response, several genes involved in glutathione metabolism are induced. Further studies confirmed a dual anti-cadmium defense, one via glutathione and another one via MTF-1 and its target genes, including metallothioneins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Mtf1</italic> conditional knockout mice and liver-specific deletion</title><p><italic>Mtf1</italic> conditional knockout mice were generated in collaboration with Dr Michael Leviten (San Carlos, CA).

The level of functional MTF-1 protein was examined by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>): MTF-1 protein&#x02013;DNA complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> control mouse, but no functional MRE-binding protein was observed with an <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> sample. Thus, deletion of exons 3 and 4 of <italic>Mtf1</italic> in the liver of <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> mice was virtually complete. All examined liver-specific knockout mice were viable under laboratory conditions and appeared normal.</p></sec><sec><title>MTF-1 target gene search</title><p>For the identification of MTF-1 target genes, we compared the liver transcript profiles of mice with and without functional <italic>Mtf1</italic> gene that had been mock-treated or exposed to cadmium (<italic>n</italic> = 3 per genotype and respective treatment).</p><p>In a first screen, the transcripts were analyzed with a differential display-based method, called amplification of double-stranded cDNA end restriction fragments (ADDER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Thereby an overwhelming number of signals was obtained for the two stress-inducible metallothioneins (<italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic>), due to the abundance of their transcripts both in mock-treated and especially in cadmium-treated livers that harbored a functional MTF-1 gene (data not shown). This result confirmed the importance of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothionein genes.</p><p>In a second approach, the gene expression profile in livers of the above mentioned mice was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). When analyzing the probe array data of livers from mock-treated <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> mice, an at least 2-fold, reliable downregulation of expression was detected in <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> livers for 13 Affymetrix GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> probe sets corresponding to 11 characterized genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, a). Seven of these genes contain one or more MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC within a segment of 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start.

The data set for livers of cadmium-treated <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> mice revealed an at least 2-fold, reliable downregulation in <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> livers for 21 probe sets corresponding to 16 different characterized genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, c); 10 of these contain MRE core consensus sequences in their upstream region.

In addition to characterized genes, ESTs and RIKEN cDNA sequences were also found in the comparison of <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> livers to be differentially expressed (Supplementary Table 1). Downregulation of <italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic> was detected in <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> livers for both conditions (though the level of significance for the downregulation of <italic>Mt1</italic> in mock-treated animals was above 0.05; data not shown).</p><p>For all MTF-1 target genes characterized so far, such as <italic>Mt1</italic>, <italic>Mt2</italic> and <italic>Znt1</italic>, MTF-1 exerts its transcriptional activation activity via standard MRE sequences located proximal to the transcription start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Even a specific search for MTF-1 binding sites by selection from a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides with random sequences yielded no new binding motif for MTF-1 in addition to the known MREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Thus, an MRE sequence is to date the only indication for a direct MTF-1 target gene, and four MRE-containing target gene candidates were further analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Basal expression of <italic>Sepw1</italic> depends on MTF-1</title><p><italic>Sepw1</italic> was found in microarray analysis to be significantly downregulated in livers from cadmium- and mock-treated <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, a and c).

In microarray analysis, the degree of the downregulation was either comparable to the one in control livers or lower, depending on the considered Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; probe set (data not shown).

An at least 2-fold, reliable upregulation was observed after cadmium exposure for 31 probe sets corresponding to 21 different characterized genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, a). For 2 probe sets corresponding to 2 characterized genes, an at least 2-fold downregulation was detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, b).</p><p>Several genes involved in the metabolism of the antioxidant glutathione were found to be upregulated by cadmium exposure, namely the genes encoding the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (<italic>Gclc</italic>) that is the rate limiting enzyme in <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>); glutathione reductase 1 (<italic>Gsr</italic>), the reducing enzyme for oxidized glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>); and glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase, mu 4 (<italic>Gstm4</italic>), which is a member of the glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase supergene family of detoxification enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).

Increasing concentrations of BSO or cadmium alone were to some extent cytotoxic for the examined cell lines. Treatment with both BSO and cadmium resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional <italic>Mtf1</italic>, indicating that a depletion of glutathione together with a lack of <italic>Mtf1</italic> impair an efficient anti-cadmium defense. Thus, adequate glutathione supply as well as MTF-1 and its target genes are essential for the survival of the cell under cadmium stress.</p><p>Besides genes related to the glutathione pathway, several other stress-related genes were upregulated upon cadmium exposure, including genes for thioredoxin reductase 1 (<italic>Txnrd1</italic>), one of the reducing enzymes of the antioxidant thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>); KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2 (<italic>Kdelr2</italic>) participating in ER stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>); and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (<italic>Bag3</italic>) involved in stress-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, a virtually complete deletion of <italic>Mtf1</italic> in the liver of adult, pI&#x02013;pC-induced <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non-stress conditions, confirming that MTF-1 is dispensable in the adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>The comparison of gene expression in livers of mock- or cadmium-treated <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> mice revealed several MTF-1 target gene candidates. Transcripts of the two stress-responsive metallothionein genes <italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic> were severely reduced, in support of a crucial role of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothioneins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>One of the newly found target genes is <italic>Sepw1</italic>. The exact molecular function of SEPW1 protein is unknown to date, but a role as antioxidant has been proposed due to its ability to bind glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In accordance with this, ectopic expression of mouse <italic>Sepw1</italic> renders cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide, and this resistance is dependent on it binding glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Furthermore, Amantana <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) showed that expression of a reporter gene fused to a rat <italic>Sepw1</italic> promoter fragment can be induced in rat glial cells by copper and zinc, but not cadmium. This response was dependent on an overlapping-inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the rat <italic>Sepw1</italic> transcription start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF-1 binding to that sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Our expression and DNA-binding studies strongly suggest that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of mouse <italic>Sepw1</italic> by binding to the corresponding overlapping-inverted MRE sequence.</p><p><italic>Ndrg1</italic>, another interesting MTF-1 target gene was named N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 following the discovery that the transcription factor N-myc represses the expression of mouse <italic>Ndrg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Transcription of <italic>Ndrg1</italic> and/or its human ortholog is induced by different physiological and cell stress conditions, such as androgens, nickel compounds, DNA damage and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). In addition, the protein is overexpressed in human cancers of many tissues, such as lung, liver, brain, breast, kidney and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Although <italic>Ndrg1</italic> and especially its human ortholog have been quite intensely studied, its function remains unclear; however, the induction by stimuli like nickel and hypoxia suggests an involvement in the cell stress response. Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that <italic>Ndrg1</italic> gene expression is also induced by cadmium, and that MTF-1 plays a crucial role in this induction.</p><p>In the case of <italic>Csrp1</italic>, expression analyses and DNA-binding studies indicate that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction by binding to an MRE upstream of the transcription start. Studies with human, avian and chicken CSRP1 have shown that this protein is localized at adhesion plaques and in association with filamentous actin, and interacts with the adhesion plaque protein zyxin, as well as the actin-cross-linking protein alpha-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). The ability to bind these partners suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Exposure of cultured cells to cadmium causes a decrease in, and destruction of, cellular contact proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). In the proximal tubule cells of the rat kidney, a partial loss of actin and the actin-bundling protein villin is observed upon cadmium treatment, as well as the derangement and depolymerization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the mouse, its upregulation by cadmium might protect the organism from damage of the cytoskeleton. Such a mechanism would expand the role of MTF-1 in stress response.</p><p>Our expression studies also suggest that MTF-1 represses basal transcription of <italic>Slc39a10</italic>, in contrast to its role as activator for the expression of other target genes like <italic>Mt1</italic>, <italic>Mt2</italic>, and <italic>Znt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). SLC39A10 is one of 14 mouse SLC39 members, which belong to the ZIP family of metal ion transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic metal ion concentrations by promoting extracellular and vesicular ion transport into the cytoplasm. ZIP proteins have been reported to be transporters of zinc, iron, manganese and/or cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Although SLC39A10 is largely uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), it is referred to in several databases as putative zinc transporter. It has been previously shown that MTF-1 is important for both basal expression and metal induction of the mouse <italic>Znt1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). ZnT proteins represent a different family of transporters that reduce intracellular cytoplasmic zinc by promoting zinc efflux from cells or into intracellular vesicles. Thus, members of the ZnT and ZIP family with zinc as predominant substrate have opposite roles in cellular zinc homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Assuming that SLC39A10 is indeed a zinc transporter, MTF-1 would control expression of two zinc transporters with antagonistic functions, namely, <italic>Znt1</italic> and <italic>Slc39a10</italic>. Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the <italic>Slc39a10</italic> transcription start. In a simple model, such a binding could interfere with the accessibility of the transcriptional start site for RNA polymerase II and/or general transcription factors, thus preventing transcription initiation of the gene. Indeed, such a mechanism has been described in yeast for the zinc-responsive activator protein 1 (Zap1) and its target gene, zinc-regulated transporter 2 (<italic>ZRT2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). However, the inhibition of <italic>Slc39a10</italic> expression by MTF-1 may well be more complex than a competition for promoter binding. Independent of MTF-1, cadmium treatment also leads to downregulation of <italic>Slc39a10</italic> transcripts, suggesting that some other factor is mediating this response.</p><p>A previous target gene search for MTF-1 with mouse embryos of conventional <italic>Mtf1</italic> knockout phenotype revealed, besides metallothionein genes, the multifunctional alpha-fetoprotein (<italic>Afp</italic>) and the liver-enriched transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (<italic>Cebpa</italic>) as prime candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). After an early onset during hepatogenesis, <italic>Afp</italic> expression is repressed postnatally and replaced by albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). Thus, our adult <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> mice lacking MTF-1 were not suitable to analyze <italic>Afp</italic> expression. <italic>Cebpa</italic> is expressed in the adult liver as well as in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>), but the present microarray data revealed no significant expression differences in livers from adult <italic>Mtf1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> and <italic>Mtf1<sup>Mx-cre</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). Therefore, MTF-1 may affect <italic>Cebpa</italic> expression only during embryonal development, perhaps in combination with as yet unidentified factors.</p><p>The present study confirms and extends the role of MTF-1 as an important stress response regulator. We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target genes of MTF-1 in the adult mouse liver: in the case of <italic>Sepw1</italic>, MTF-1 is required to maintain basal expression, supporting a role of mouse MTF-1 in oxidative stress response. In addition, MTF-1 contributes to the cadmium-induced expression of <italic>Ndrg1</italic> and <italic>Csrp1</italic>. Furthermore, MTF-1 helps to repress the basal expression of <italic>Slc39a10</italic>, in contrast to its role as transcriptional activator for genes like <italic>Mt1</italic>, <italic>Mt2</italic> or <italic>Znt1</italic>. Thus the same transcription factor apparently serves as an activator or repressor, depending on the target gene.</p><p>The comparison of liver gene expression of cadmium- and mock-treated mice also revealed a number of genes that were responsive to cadmium exposure, independent of the presence or absence of MTF-1. Evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>), and exposure of cultured cells or animals to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). Oxidative stress and the subsequent restoration of cellular homeostasis have been shown to induce the expression of genes encoding acute-phase proteins and antioxidant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>). In mammals, cadmium tends to accumulate in the kidney and liver as a cadmium-metallothionein complex that has an extremely slow turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). Furthermore, metallothioneins provide protection against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition to metallothioneins, glutathione was postulated as a first line of defense against cadmium toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>). Glutathione efficiently complexes cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>) and scavenges free radicals and other reactive oxygen species directly, and indirectly via enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In such reactions, glutathione is oxidized and has to be regenerated by glutathione reductase. Also, glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferases mediate the conjugation of various electrophiles to glutathione. The observed cadmium-induced upregulation of <italic>Gclc</italic>, <italic>Gsr</italic> and <italic>Gstm4</italic> supports the importance of glutathione in the cellular cadmium response. The enhanced sensitivity to cadmium toxicity that we found for mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of <italic>Mtf1</italic> deletion and depletion of glutathione further corroborates the importance of MTF-1 and its target genes as well as reduced glutathione for an efficient anti-cadmium defense.</p><p>Our data provide strong evidence for at least two branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense, one via MTF-1 and its target genes, notably metallothioneins, the other via glutathione, with an apparent overlap in <italic>Sepw1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data are available at NAR online.</p></sec>
