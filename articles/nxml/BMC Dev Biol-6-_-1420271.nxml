ES cells have two important properties: theability to maintain pluripotency, which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells, and rapid proliferation. These characteristics make mouse ES cells an essential component of gene targeting technology. These qualitiesalso make human ES cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases, including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of ES cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To identify molecules essential in ES cells for these properties, several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify genes specifically expressed in ES cells and early embryos. These analyses, including DNA microarray analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and expressed sequence tag analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], identified several common transcripts, including <italic>ESG1 </italic>that was also designated <italic>dppa5 </italic>or <italic>ECAT2</italic>.</p><p>ESG1 was originally identified as a transcript Ph34 that was down-regulated by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The expression of this gene was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is also expressed in pluripotent cells, including ES cells, embryonic germ cells, and multipotent germline stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>ESG1 </italic>encodes a polypeptide of 118 amino acids that contains a single KH domain, which is an RNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It remains unclear, however, if ESG1 functions as an RNA-binding protein or the roles it plays in ES cells and mice.</p><p>Previous genomic library screening by identified genomic clones containing the mouse <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene and seven pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Two of these pseudogenes exhibit a similar exon-intron structure as the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene, indicating their generation by gene duplication. The five remaining pseudogenes did not contain any introns, indicating that these were generated by retrotransposition of <italic>ESG1 </italic>transcripts. The chromosomal localizations of the mouse <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene and pseudogenes, however, have not been reported.</p><p>In this study, we determined the structure of the mouse gene encoding this protein and related pseudogenes. We also performed gene targeting to determine the physiological function of ESG1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Chromosomal localization and structures of mouse <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene and psedogenes</title><p>To determine the chromosomal localizations of the mouse <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene and pseudogenes, we performed a Blast analysis of the mouse genomic database with the <italic>ESG1 </italic>cDNA sequence as a query. We identified several putative pseudogenes without introns on chromosomes 1, 5, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, and X (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, two intron-less pseudogenes were identified in DNA fragments for which the chromosomal localization remained unmapped. While these pseudodgenes have significant homology to <italic>ESG1 </italic>cDNA, they could not produce functional proteins, because of critical mutations. This result suggests that there are a larger number of intron-less pseudogenes than previously anticipated. Existence of multiple retropseudogenes is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ESG1</italic>pseudogenes identified by a Blast search of mouse genomic databases</bold>. Substitution mutations are indicated by black lines. Intron-like gap sequences are indicated with triangles. Chromosomal localizations are shown on the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-6-11-1"/></fig><p>On chromosome 9, we identified a DNA fragment similar to the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene that included two putative introns. These putative first and second exons, however, contained (4) multiple mutations of the <italic>ESG1 </italic>cDNA sequence. The putative third exon was identical to that of the previously reported <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene. Also on chromosome 9, we identified another DNA fragment that was similar, but not identical, to the third exon of the ESG1 gene. These findings suggest that these <italic>ESG1</italic>-like sequences on chromosome 9 have not been correctly assembled.</p><p>To obtain DNA fragments containing the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene, we screened the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA pool by PCR using primer pairs that would only amplify the real gene, not the pseudogenes. We obtained two independent, but overlapping BAC clones. Southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these clones contained a sequence exhibiting complete identity with <italic>ESG1 </italic>cDNA that was interrupted by two putative introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The two intron sequences begin with GT and terminate with AG, fulfilling the GT-AG rule of exon-intron junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The 5' flanking region of this DNA fragment exhibited strong promoter/enhancer activity by luciferase reporter assays in undifferentiated ES cells, but not in somatic cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The same fragment showed much weaker activity after induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. We concluded that this sequence is the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>BAC clones containing the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene and a duplication pseudogene (PS)</bold>.

Data represent the averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-6-11-3"/></fig><p>We also found that the two BAC clones contained another <italic>ESG1</italic>-like sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The two sequences, separated by a 68 kbp intergenic sequence, were oriented in opposite directions. The <italic>ESG1</italic>-like sequence exhibited greater than 95% identity to the exons and introns of the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene. This sequence, however, contained critical nucleotide substitutions in all of the exons and one nucleotide insertion in exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Although 675 base pairs of the 3' flanking regions were conserved between the ESG1 gene and the pseudogene, only five base pairs of the 5' flanking region were identical. This 5' flanking region (~6 kbp) did not possess any promoter/enhancer activity in luciferase reporter assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It is thus unlikely that this sequence is transcribed or translated into a functional protein. This sequence likely represents a duplication pseudogene. Bierbaum previously reported the existence of two pseudogenes with similar exon-intron organization as the <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We could not determine which of these two pseudogenes corresponds to the one we identified or the location of the remaining pseudogene.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted disruption of the mouse <italic>ESG1 </italic>gene</title><p>To study the function of ESG1, we deleted the gene by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells. We replaced the three exons with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and &#x003b2;-galactosidase genes (&#x003b2;-geo) or the hygromycin resistant gene (HygR) using two targeting vectors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) introduced into RF8 ES cells by electroporation. We obtained eight ES cell clones with correct homologous recombination of the &#x003b2;-geo targeting vector, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of ESG1 in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In 29 clones, the &#x003b2;-geo vector had replaced the HygR vector, such that the cells remained heterozygous. In the remaining 27 clones, the &#x003b2;-geo vector was integrated at non-homologous sites.</p><p><italic>ESG1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells exhibited normal morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

When transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice, these cells produced teratomas, tumors containing components of all three germ layers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

The probe hybridized to an 11.5 kbp band from the wild-type locus, a 12.5 kbp band from the &#x003b2;-geo locus, and a 9.5 kbp band from the HygR locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of anti-ESG1 polyclonal antibodies</title><p>The coding sequence of <italic>Esg1 </italic>was amplified by PCR with the pH34-gw-s (5'- AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGATGGTGACCCTCGTGA-3') and pH34-gw-as (5'- AGAAAGCTGGGTCTGCATCCAGGTCGGAGACA-3') primers. To construct pDONR-pH34, the resulting PCR product was subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen). pDONR-pH34 was interacted with pDEST17 (Invitrogen) by LR recombination. After introduction of the resulting expression vector pDEST17-pH34 into BL21-AI <italic>E. coli </italic>(Invitrogen), recombinant protein production was induced according to the manufacture's protocol. Histidine-tagged ESG1 was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions in the presence of 8 M urea. After dialysis against 6 M urea, the recombinant proteins were injected into New Zealand White rabbits to generate anti-ESG1 polyclonal antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>After preparation of ES cell extracts with M-Per (Pierce), cellular proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-14% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with anti-ESG1 (1/500 dilution), anti-Oct3/4 (1/500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CDK4 (1/200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-GFP (1/1000; MBL) primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1/5000; Cell Signaling) were used to detect antibody binding. We visualized bound antibody with an ECL Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Derivation of ESG1-deficient ES cells from blastocysts</title><p><italic>Esg1</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>or ESG1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant female mice were injected with Tamoxifen (10 &#x003bc;g) and Depo-provera (1 mg) subcutaneously on the third day of pregnancy. Four days later, embryos in diapause were flushed out of the uterus and cultured on STO feeder cells in four-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomysin (Invitrogen), and 0.11 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). After six days, the central mass of each explant was harvested, rinsed in PBS, and placed in a drop of trypsin for a few minutes. The cell mass was collected with a finely drawn-out Pasteur pipette preloaded with medium, ensuring minimal carryover of the trypsin. The cells were gently transfered into a fresh well with 20% FBS-containing medium. The resulting primary ES cell colonies were individually passaged into wells of four-well plates containing STO feeder cell layers. Thereafter, cells were expanded by trypsinization of the entire culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarrays</title><p>Total RNA from wild-type ES cells and ESG1<sup>-/- </sup>ES cells was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The samples were hybridized to a Mouse Development Microarray (Algilent) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Arrays were scanned with a G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent). Hybridization was repeated with two independent clones. Data were analyzed with GeneSprings software (Silico Genetics).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HA carried out the phenotypic studies of ESG1 knockout mice. KI determined the chromosomal localizations of the ESG1 gene and pseudogenes and constructed the targeting vector. TI carried out mouse embryo manipulation. MM and MN carried out ES cell culture. SY conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chihiro Takigawa, Junko Iida, Masako Shirasaka, Yumi Ohuchi, and Megumi Narita for their technical and administrative assistance.
