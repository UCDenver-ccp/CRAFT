Hypoxia is thus a critical parameter in muscle function, influencing production of ATP, utilization of energy-producing substrates, and manufacture of exhaustion-inducing metabolites. Glycolysis is the central source of anaerobic energy in animals, and this metabolic pathway is regulated under low-oxygen conditions by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;). To determine the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in regulating skeletal muscle function, we tissue-specifically deleted the gene encoding the factor in skeletal muscle. Significant exercise-induced changes in expression of genes are decreased or absent in the skeletal-muscle HIF-1&#x003b1; knockout mice (HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs); changes in activities of glycolytic enzymes are seen as well. There is an increase in activity of rate-limiting enzymes of the mitochondria in the muscles of HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, indicating that the citric acid cycle and increased fatty acid oxidation may be compensating for decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway. This is corroborated by a finding of no significant decreases in muscle ATP, but significantly decreased amounts of lactate in the serum of exercising HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs. This metabolic shift away from glycolysis and toward oxidation has the consequence of increasing exercise times in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs. However, repeated exercise trials give rise to extensive muscle damage in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, ultimately resulting in greatly reduced exercise times relative to wild-type animals. The muscle damage seen is similar to that detected in humans in diseases caused by deficiencies in skeletal muscle glycogenolysis and glycolysis. Thus, these results demonstrate an important role for the HIF-1 pathway in the metabolic control of muscle function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Mice that can't express HIF-1&#x003b1; in skeletal muscle don't induce glycolytic genes and thus switch to aerobic metabolism allowing them to run uphill longer than the their wild-type littermates</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During exercise in normoxia, the partial pressure of oxygen in muscle tissue has been shown to dip to as low as 3.1 mm Hg, whereas in the capillary, it remains at 38 mm Hg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Hoppeler1">Hoppeler et al. 2003</xref>). In order to maintain effort, skeletal muscle exertion must be able to rely on pathways designed to help the tissue cope with oxygen stress after oxygen delivery capacity is exceeded. A switch between aerobic and nonaerobic metabolism during strenuous exertion requires mechanisms to adjust metabolic function, and this need is acute in extended exertion in skeletal muscle. It is clear that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) is an essential factor in maintenance of ATP levels in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Seagroves1">Seagroves et al. 2001</xref>). In fact, although HIF-1&#x003b1; is typically thought of as acting only during hypoxia, its loss has an effect on both normoxic and hypoxic ATP levels in a number of tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Seagroves1">Seagroves et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Cramer1">Cramer et al. 2003</xref>), and this implicates the factor in regulation of metabolic function even during conditions of normal physiologic oxygenation.</p><p>In skeletal muscle, signaling of fatigue has been studied extensively, and signaling of exhaustion involves, to some degree, elevated systemic lactic acid, a by-product of the glycolytic pathway of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Myers1">Myers and Ashley 1997</xref>). Thus, the glycolytic pathway is intrinsically involved in muscle function and fatigue, and this in turn is linked to the response to hypoxia. To understand how the primary hypoxia-responsive transcription factor controls skeletal muscle function, we targeted mouse skeletal muscle for tissue-specific deletion of <italic>HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> via the use of a conditionally targeted allele of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Ryan1">Ryan et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Schipani1">Schipani et al. 2001</xref>). This mouse strain was crossed into a strain transgenic for the skeletal-muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter, which drives expression of the <italic>cre</italic> recombinase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Bruning1">Bruning et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Sauer1">Sauer 1998</xref>). We found that loss of the regulation of hypoxic response in muscle has a profound effect on the function of the muscle during exertion, with effects that mimic human metabolic myopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>In 4-mo&#x02013;old mice with the skeletal-muscle <italic>HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> gene knocked out (HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs), the frequency of excision was evaluated through real-time PCR techniques. We saw deletion frequencies consistent with those described previously for this <italic>cre</italic> recombinase transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Bruning1">Bruning et al. 1998</xref>) with some variation in penetration; mean frequency of deletion was 54.9&#x00025;, with the highest frequency of muscle-specific deletion of HIF-1&#x003b1; being 72&#x00025; in the gastrocnemius of 4-mo&#x02013;old mice homozygous for the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t001">Table 1</xref>). This transgene is expressed at a lower level in cardiac tissue, and cardiac deletion was detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t001">Table 1</xref>); however, none of the phenotypes described below were seen in cardiac myocyte-specific deletions of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Gross muscle sections were evaluated histologically to evaluate both vascularization and fiber type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t003">3</xref>), and ultrastructurally to determine number of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). No changes were detected in any of these features in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, except for a slight but statistically significant decrease in type IIA fibers in the soleus muscles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t003">Table 3</xref>). Similar hematocrit and blood hemoglobin levels were seen in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs and wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t004">Table 4</xref>, significant changes in HIF-1&#x003b1;&#x02013;dependent gene expression occur in muscle during exercise, including changes in genes involved in glucose transport and metabolism. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which increases vascular permeability, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), the muscle-specific glucose transporter, show increased levels in exercise and likely increase the availability of glucose to the muscle. The muscle-specific form of phosphofructokinase (PFK-M), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) are also up-regulated at the mRNA level by exercise, and this up-regulation is inhibited by the loss of HIF-1&#x003b1;, further demonstrating that HIF-1&#x003b1; is important for transcriptional response during skeletal muscle activity.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t005">Table 5</xref>, we show the changes in enzymatic activity in a number of key glycolytic enzymes affected by deletion of HIF-1&#x003b1;. As can be seen from the data, several of the enzymes assayed showed a decrease in activity in response to exercise. In particular, the activity of one of the key rate-limiting enzymes, PFK, was significantly lower following exercise in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs compared to WT mice, indicating that HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs may have difficulty maintaining optimal PFK activity. The responses of other glycolytic enzymes to exercise were fairly similar between WT mice and HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs. These include no significant changes in phosphoglucose isomerase activity and significant, yet similar, decreases in aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and PGK activities. An exception to this is that WT muscles were able to significantly increase pyruvate kinase (PK) activity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020288-t004">Table 4</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). LDH activity was also increased in the WT mice, although the level did not reach statistical significance. Activities of both PK and LDH were not significantly changed in HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscles following exercise. Increased activities of PK, and subsequently LDH, could be expected to lead to increased levels of lactate in the WT mice relative to HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs.In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, it can be seen that the decrease in PFK activity in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs is correlated with a trend approaching significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10) toward an increased amount of hexose monophosphates (HMPs), which are pre-PFK glycolytic metabolites, following stimulation of the HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscle. This increase was not due to differences in glucose uptake, since animals of both genotypes were able to significantly increase intramuscular glucose to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Consistent with decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway, however, the increased amount of HMPs was correlated with increased muscle glycogenolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and increased depletion of phosphocreatine (PCr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), with a resultant decrease in the PCr/ATP ratio in HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), although there was only a nonsignificant drop in overall muscle ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Intramuscular levels of lactate did increase in both HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs and WT mice during stimulation, although lactate accumulation did not differ significantly between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). In order to evaluate whether these changes had any effect on overall muscle force, we measured force and calcium release in isolated single fibers; as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g004">4</xref>B, there were no significant changes in these parameters, indicating that the muscle can compensate at this level for the metabolic changes induced by loss of HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>Given altered levels of glycolytic throughput without significant changes in intramuscular ATP levels, it is likely that there is increased activity of oxidative pathways in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscle. Increased muscle oxidative activity is typical in patients with myopathies involving muscle glycolysis or glycogenolysis, including phosphofructokinase disease (PFKD) and McArdle's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Vissing1">Vissing et al. 1996</xref>). We analyzed the activity of citrate synthase (CS), a key allosteric enzyme of the citric acid cycle, in WT and HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and found that it was up-regulated in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs. CS is a mitochondrial enzyme that responds to decreases in ATP concentration allosterically, allowing for increased oxidative activity in the mitochondria. In addition, significant up-regulation of the mitochondrial enzyme beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (B-HAD) was seen in HIF-1&#x003b1; KO muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). B-HAD is also affected by energy levels in the cell, and decreases in NADH/NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration ratios cause the enzyme to increase mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Nelson1">Nelson and Cox 2000</xref>). Increased activity of oxidative pathways in the muscle should result in more rapid lactate clearance, as in fact occurs in PFKD patients during exercise; this phenomenon gives rise to a &#x0201c;second wind&#x0201d; in these patients, and under some circumstances allows for an increase in exercise endurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Vissing1">Vissing et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Haller1">Haller and Vissing 2002</xref>), although this was disputed in one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Haller2">Haller and Vissing 2004</xref>). This decreased lactate accumulation postexercise clearly occurs in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g005">Figure 5</xref>C. This systemically lower level of lactate postexercise indicates that there may be a shift toward a more oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle.</p><p>As mentioned above, patients with muscle glycolytic deficiencies demonstrate both increased exercise-induced muscle damage and a &#x0201c;second wind&#x0201d;; the latter phenomenon allows them to exercise for extended periods of time at submaximal levels. This is thought to be due to an increase in rates of oxidative ATP production, and a decreased utilization of and need for muscle glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Vissing1">Vissing et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Haller1">Haller and Vissing 2002</xref>). To assess whether this is also the case in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, both WT mice and HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were subjected to endurance tests to assess muscle function. To first determine whether HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were capable of extended activity during exercise, the animals were given a swimming endurance test. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were capable of significantly longer-duration swimming activity when compared to matched WT controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Further testing was done to determine the parameters of this increased endurance. HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were run on an enclosed treadmill, with a 5&#x000b0; incline and an initial velocity of 10 m/min, with an increase in velocity every 5 min. In their first runs, HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs again had significantly greater endurance, as shown by their consistently longer run times compared to WT controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>As it has been shown that muscle groups and fibers respond differently to eccentric exercise (i.e., downhill running) than to concentric exercise (i.e., uphill running) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Nardone1">Nardone and Schieppati 1988</xref>), mice from both genotypes were run on a 10&#x000b0; decline with the same velocity and time parameters as in the uphill runs. Eccentric exercises have been shown to recruit primarily fast-twitch glycolytic fibers for contraction, as opposed to the traditional recruitment of slower, smaller, oxidative motor units in concentric contraction, where animals with an increased capacity for muscle oxidation would be at an advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Nardone1">Nardone and Schieppati 1988</xref>). Now, the trend from swimming and uphill running tests was reversed, with WT mice able to run for a significantly longer time than HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Within genotypes, WT mice ran for significantly longer times downhill than uphill (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01); HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs did the reverse, and ran for significantly shorter times downhill than uphill (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Substrate utilization confirms the shift toward glycolytic fibers in downhill running; both genotypes had higher average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values when running downhill compared with running uphill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g006">6</xref>E).</p><p>PFKD and McArdle's disease demonstrate significant myopathic effects in muscle, including soreness and cramping induced by bouts of exercise. After 1 d of recovery from endurance testing, HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs had increased levels of the MM isoform of creatine kinase in their serum (unpublished data), indicative of skeletal muscle damage. To further investigate this finding, mice were run on a treadmill daily for 4 d. By the second day, the trend for increased endurance in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs was absent, and by the final day, HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were running for significantly shorter times than they had on the first day (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In addition, a repeated measures ANOVA performed on run times showed that the response of the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs to the protocol was significantly different than that of the WT mice (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Histological examination of gastrocnemius tissue following 1 d of recovery revealed significantly greater amounts of muscle damage in HIF-1&#x003b1; KO tissue than WT tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Staining of the tissue for proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) and counts of positive nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Olive1">Olive et al. 1995</xref>) also revealed more cell division in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs than in WTs, another indication that HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs had been subject to greater tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g007">7</xref>D).</p><p>As noted above, both PFKD and McArdle's disease are marked by increased resting intramuscular levels of glycogen, a failure of serum lactate to rise during exertion, an exercise-induced &#x0201c;second wind,&#x0201d; and signs of muscle damage following exertion, including elevated levels of creatine kinase in the serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Tarui1">Tarui et al. 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Layzer1">Layzer et al. 1967</xref>). In addition, PFKD is characterized by elevated levels of HMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Tarui1">Tarui et al. 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Layzer1">Layzer et al. 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Argov1">Argov et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Grehl1">Grehl et al. 1998</xref>) and greater PCr utilization during contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Argov1">Argov et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020288-Grehl1">Grehl et al. 1998</xref>). We see many of these hallmarks of muscle deficiencies in glycolytic processing in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs. The effects are not likely due to glucose uptake, as WT and HIF-1&#x003b1; KO intramuscular glucose levels were not different at rest or following stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), and both types of mice responded similarly to a glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff (PAS) staining of tissue from mice of both genotypes gave further demonstration of increased glycogen levels in resting muscles from HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020288-g008">Figure 8</xref>B).</p><p>Given the differences in performance observed in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs in eccentric and concentric exercise, it is clear that the HIF-1 pathway and hypoxic response have a central role in determining the capacity for work and endurance through regulation of glycolysis. It is also clear that these mice will provide an important model system to investigate the physiology of muscle response during work and oxygen depletion, and may be useful as a model for a group of very debilitating myopathic syndromes in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>Mouse strains and crosses.</title><p>Mice were generated from <italic>HIF-1&#x003b1; loxP</italic>-flanked allele mouse stocks backcrossed into a C57Bl6/J background.

stimulation protocol. Resting values represent levels in the unstimulated gastrocnemius from the same animals. HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs had a trend toward greater accumulated levels of HMPs during the stimulation protocol, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10). This difference could be indicative of a blockage in the glycolytic pathway at PFK.</p><p>(B) No significant differences were seen between HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs and WT intramuscular glucose levels at rest or following stimulation. Both HIF-1&#x003b1; KO and WT muscles were able to significantly increase glucose uptake, leading to greater levels of intramuscular glucose in response to stimulation (WT, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; KO, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>(C) HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs have more stored glycogen than do WT mice. Glycogen levels were measured following the same stimulation protocol as in (B). The change in glycogen from rest to poststimulation was also greater in the HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs, indicating that they metabolized more glycogen in response to stimulation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; &#x0002a;<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, WT at rest vs. KO at rest).</p><p>(D) HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs utilize more PCr in response to stimulation than do WT mice.

A trend toward a greater drop from rest to poststimulation in the PCr/ATP ratio was also seen in HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs following stimulation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.10), indicating that they had to rely more heavily on PCr for ATP generation.</p><p>(F) Slight but nonsignificant differences were seen in whole-muscle ATP levels at rest or following stimulation. Although HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs exhibited altered substrate utilization, they were able to meet their ATP demands during the protocol.</p><p>(G) Both HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs and WT animals produced significant intramuscular lactate during the stimulation protocol; however, there was no significant difference in the amount produced by either genotype.

HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs demonstrated initially greater endurance under the protocol; however, by the second day, their endurance advantage was eliminated, and by the fourth day, HIF-1&#x003b1; KOs were running for a significantly shorter time (&#x0002a;&#x0002a;<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) than on the first day, while WT animals were running for approximately similar times as on the first day.
