Some extremely obese people are not diabetic, while other less obese people develop severe insulin resistance and diabetes. We believe diabetes occurs when adipose tissue becomes &#x0201c;full,&#x0201d; and fat overflows into other organs such as liver, pancreas, and muscle, causing insulin resistance and diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is essential for the development of adipose tissue and control of insulin sensitivity. PPARg2 is the isoform of PPARg regulated by nutrition. Here we investigate the role of PPARg2 under conditions of excess nutrients by removing the PPARg2 isoform in genetically obese mice, the POKO mouse. We report that removing PPARg2 decreases adipose tissue's capacity to expand and prevents the mouse from making as much fat as a normal obese mouse, despite eating similarly. Our studies suggest that PPARg plays an important antitoxic role when it is induced in liver, muscle, and beta cells by facilitating deposition of fat as relatively harmless lipids and thus prevents accumulation of toxic lipid species. We also show that PPARg2 may be involved in the adaptive response of beta cells to insulin resistance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Medina-Gomez G, Gray SL, Yetukuri L, Shimomura K, Virtue S, et al.

However, the link between obesity and insulin resistance is complex, as indicated by the fact that some extremely obese people are glucose tolerant, while others with a mild degree of obesity develop severe insulin resistance and diabetes. This suggests that the absolute amount of fat stored may not be the most important factor determining the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. Recent work showing the complexity of the molecular mechanisms controlling adipogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; suggests that adipose tissue expandability may be an important factor linking obesity, insulin resistance, and associated comorbidities.</p><p>There are two mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how expansion of the adipose tissue stores affects insulin sensitivity. One mechanism suggests that increased adiposity induces a chronic inflammatory state characterized by increased cytokine production by adipocytes and/or from macrophages infiltrating adipose tissue. Cytokines produced by these adipocytes or macrophages may directly antagonise insulin signalling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. A second nonexclusive hypothesis is lipotoxicity. The lipotoxic hypothesis states that if the amount of fuel entering a tissue exceeds its oxidative or storage capacity, toxic metabolites that inhibit insulin action are formed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Of particular relevance to this article, lipid metabolites, such as ceramides and diacylglycerol (DAG) or reactive oxygen species generated from hyperactive oxidative pathways, have been shown to inhibit insulin signalling and to induce apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is critically required for adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. There are two PPARg isoforms, PPARg1 and PPARg2. PPARg1 is expressed in many tissues and cell types, including white and brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, macrophages, colon, bone, and placenta &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

In adipose tissue PPARg is the key regulator of adipogenesis. PPARg2 is the more adipogenic PPARg isoform in vitro, it is also the isoform regulated transcriptionally by nutrition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

De novo expression of PPARg2 in liver and muscle in obesity suggests that PPARg2 may have a role in insulin resistance and lipotoxicity in these tissues. Little in vivo research into the metabolic roles for the specific isoforms of PPARg has been carried out, with the studies so far focusing almost exclusively on adipose tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. PPARg (both isoforms) deletions have been generated in most major metabolic tissues. Liver-specific deletion of both PPARg isoforms caused an impairment in insulin sensitivity, particularly when challenged by different genetic backgrounds (lipoatrophic or leptin-deficiency) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

The role of PPARg in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells is unclear, primarily due to its low expression under physiological conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and secondly because ablation of both PPARg isoforms in &#x003b2;-cells did not result in a metabolic phenotype. However PPARg may play a role in &#x003b2;-cell hyperplasia in response to insulin resistance, an idea supported by the fact that mice that lack PPARg in &#x003b2;-cells do not expand their &#x003b2;-cells mass in response to a high-fat diet &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

We use a new approach that integrates traditional physiological phenotyping with advanced lipidomic technology and transcriptomics. Our results indicate that in the context of positive energy balance, the absence of PPARg2 results in a major metabolic failure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that control of adipose tissue expansion by PPARg2 may be an important variable linking positive energy balance to its metabolic complications including insulin resistance, &#x003b2;-cell failure, and dyslipidaemia. Similarly, our lipidomic results indicate that induction of PPARg2 in nonadipose tissues should be considered as a physiological adaptation that prevents the toxic effects produced by excess nutrients. This antilipotoxic effect of PPARg2 is achieved by increasing the lipid-buffering capacity of peripheral organs and facilitating &#x003b2;-cell hyperplasia in response to insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ablation of PPARg2 in Ob/Ob Mice (POKO Mouse) Prevents Adipose Tissue Expansion in Response to Positive Energy Balance</title><p>PPARg2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Lep<sup>ob</sup>/Lep<sup>ob</sup> mice with genetic ablation of the PPARg2 isoform on the obese hyperphagic ob/ob background (POKO) were generated.

Surprisingly insulin resistance developed very early in life with elevated insulin levels and blood glucose compared to ob/ob mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030064-t001">Table 1</xref>). We investigated whether peripheral insulin resistance and/or a severe defect in insulin secretion may cause hyperglycaemia in the POKO mouse.

At weaning (three weeks of age) total body weight was indistinguishable amongst the four genotypes, and blood glucose levels were similar in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, by the age of four weeks, coincident with the change to a chow diet, male and female POKO mice developed severe hyperglycaemia compared to the other genotypes.

An emerging concept is that the absolute amount of fat stored may be less important than the remaining storage capacity of the adipose tissue. Here we show that the PPARg2 isoform may be an important factor controlling obesity-induced comorbidities through two mechanisms: (a) by regulating nutritionally induced adipose tissue expandability and (b) when de novo expressed in nonadipose tissues, by allowing the storage of energy in the form of relatively harmless TAG species.</p><p>Previously we described the metabolic phenotype of the adult PPARg2 KO mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, characterised by mild insulin resistance observed only in males. Given the greater adipogenic potency of PPARg2 compared with PPARg1 in vitro, we expected PPARg2 KO mice to have many more severe defects in adipose tissue than we observed, and therefore insulin sensitivity. As PPARg2 is the PPARg isoform regulated in response to nutrition and obesity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, we hypothesised that PPARg2 would only become essential for adipose tissue function in the face of positive energy balance. The metabolic challenge we opted for was PPARg2 ablation in the obese (ob/ob) background (PPARg2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Lep<sup>ob</sup>/Lep<sup>ob</sup>, POKO mouse). The POKO mouse had severely decreased body-fat mass due to impaired adipose tissue expandability. Despite eating as much as an ob/ob mouse and expending a similar amount of energy, the POKO mouse was unable to store fat efficiently in its adipose tissue. This mismatch between increased energy availability and lack of adipose tissue expandability lead to a global metabolic failure characterised by severe insulin resistance, &#x003b2;-cell failure, and dyslipidaemia.</p><p>The observation of reduced fat mass and increased insulin resistance in the POKO mouse compared to the ob/ob mouse strongly supports two of our hypotheses. First, we hypothesised that PPARg2 is required to recruit new adipocytes in overnutrition, but it is not required to make adipocytes during development. This is reflected by similar expression of aP2, a late marker of adipocyte differentiation, in POKO and ob/ob mice. The absence of small adipocytes was markedly different to other forms of lipodystrophy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, and again in contrast with other lipodystrophic models that have markedly less adipose tissue than WT controls &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, the POKO mice had a percentage body fat that was similar (only 4&#x00025; more) to WT and PPARg2 KO mice, as opposed to ob/ob mice, which had 40&#x00025; fat as a proportion of body mass. This suggests that the remaining PPARg1 isoform is sufficient to support development of adipose tissue and fat deposition requirements of a lean mouse model. However, under conditions of positive energy balance, adipose tissue expandability mainly relies on the PPARg2 isoform. This idea is also suggested by the studies in heterozygous mice harbouring the murine equivalent of the human mutation <italic>(P465L)</italic> in PPARg on an ob/ob background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. These mice were able to accumulate fat and become obese even though showing a body mass 14&#x00025; lower than ob/ob controls. In humans there is also evidence for a role for PPARg2. We have observed that metabolically healthy, nondiabetic, morbidly obese individuals have elevated levels of PPARg2 in their adipose tissue when compared to lean individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Our second hypothesis, that the mismatch between energy availability and adipose tissue expandability is more important than fat mass itself as a predictor of insulin resistance, is also supported by our data. In fact the ob/ob mouse is much more obese than the POKO mouse but is much less insulin resistant. Furthermore, the POKO mice were already more insulin resistant than the ob/ob mice by the age of four weeks, with very low levels of GLUT4 in adipose tissue, before large differences in body weight developed, suggesting that the bioenergetic mismatch rather than the total amount of fat stored is important for the development of insulin resistance.</p><p>Although we hypothesised that the POKO mice would become insulin resistant, the degree of hyperglycaemia in these animals was in excess of what we expected. We found that the normal adaptive response of &#x003b2;-cells to insulin resistance did not occur in the POKO mice as indicated by the pathological changes observed by histology and the lack of &#x003b2;-cell hypertrophy. Although it has been shown that genetic background can affect the ability of ob/ob mice to undergo &#x003b2;-cell hypertrophy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, we found that the ob/ob controls on our mixed 129Sv &#x000d7; C57BL/6J background underwent adaptive &#x003b2;-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, suggesting that the lack of PPARg2 was responsible for the failure of the POKO &#x003b2;-cells to adapt to insulin resistance. Interestingly the mass of pancreatic islets in POKO mice remained similar to the noninsulin resistant WT and PPARg2 KO mice. Furthermore, these defects in POKO &#x003b2;-cells did not appear to be the result of a developmental defect, as new born and four-week-old mice had morphologically normal islets.</p><p>The severe &#x003b2;-cell phenotype of the POKO mouse contrasts with the absence of hyperglycaemia observed in the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell specific PPARg KO mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However it should be kept in mind that in the &#x003b2;-cell specific PPARg KO mouse, the expression of PPARg and the lipid storage capacity of other tissues, most importantly adipose tissue, were not affected, and that insulin sensitivity was only mildly affected by high fat feeding in these mice when compared to the severe insulin resistance observed in POKO mice. Therefore the challenge to the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells in this model was milder than in POKO mice. This is a clear example of how tissue-specific genetic manipulations are not always the best approach to understand the physiology of an organ in the context of the global energy homeostasis. The potential importance of the de novo expression of PPARg2 isoform in &#x003b2;-cells is also supported by the observation that humans harbouring the Pro12Ala mutation in PPARg2, a mutation that is located in the g2 isoform and makes PPARg2 less active, has only been associated with insulin deficiency and disease severity in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The liver of the POKO mouse also displayed an unusual phenotype. We expected the POKO mice to have worse hepatosteatosis with increased triglyceride deposition in liver compared to ob/ob mice, because the POKO mice could not store fat in adipose tissue. However POKO mice had less hepatosteatosis than ob/ob mice suggesting that the PPARg2 isoform may directly contribute to facilitate triglyceride deposition in the liver.</p><p>A common mechanistic link for the phenotypes observed in the POKO liver and &#x003b2;-cell was not immediately obvious. To try to determine the role of PPARg2 in these locations we performed lipidomic and gene expression analyses of the adipose tissue, pancreatic islet, liver, and skeletal muscle of the POKO mouse. The lipid pattern of adipose tissue from POKO mice was characterised by decreased TAGs and increased DAGs in parallel with decreased gene expression of DGAT2, hormone-sensitive lipase, and adipose triglyceride lipase. This decrease in TAGs in the POKO adipose tissue was associated with increased levels of reactive lipid species and a gene expression profile suggestive of increased oxidative stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b045">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Although it has been described that oxidative stress and insulin resistance may be related to infiltration of adipose tissue by macrophages, resulting in a chronic state of inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b050">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, we did not observe increased macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue of POKO mice compared to that of ob/ob mice.</p><p>Lipidomic analysis of POKO derived islets also showed decreased levels of triacyl and DAGs and increased levels of ceramides, suggesting that PPARg2 may contribute to increasing the lipid-buffering capacity of &#x003b2;-cells by promoting formation of TAGs and thus preventing lipotoxic insults. Liver and skeletal muscle lipidomics also showed reduced TAG and increased formation of reactive lipid species such as ceramides and lysophosphatidylcholines in POKO mice compared to ob/ob mice. This lipid profile was associated with impaired expression of pathways controlling de novo lipogenesis, transport of fatty acids, and beta oxidation in the POKO mice compared with the ob/ob mice. Of interest, <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and other gluconeogenic genes were induced in the liver of POKO mice compared to that of ob/ob mice, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to marked hyperglycaemia in POKO mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030064-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Overall, our lipidomic studies identify a remarkably similar pattern of changes in lipid species in the four tissues studied. The reduced adipose tissue mass and hepatosteatosis in the POKO mouse compared to the ob/ob mouse is explained by reduced levels of mature TAG in the POKO mouse. Similarly, ablation of PPARg2 resulted in accumulation of reactive lipid species implicated in causing insulin resistance, not only in adipose tissue, but also in other organs involved in whole-organism glucose metabolism. These results indicate that expression of PPARg2 in the pancreas, liver, and muscle of the ob/ob mouse may be performing a protective role, by increasing the capacity of these organs to buffer toxic lipid species by allowing accumulation of relatively harmless TAGs. The importance of this peripheral antilipotoxic role of PPARg2 becomes more evident if we consider that POKO and ob/ob mice are under the same degree of positive energy balance as determined by similar food intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure, that both models lack leptin, and that the only difference between ob/ob and POKO mice is the presence or absence of PPARg2. Given the decreased adipose tissue expandability of the POKO mice compared to ob/ob, it was anticipated that, as in the liver, muscle, or &#x003b2;-cells of lipodistrophic mice, the POKO mouse would accumulate more fat than the ob/ob. However, our results clearly indicate that mice lacking PPARg2, despite massive nutrient availability, are unable to deposit TAG in peripheral tissues and instead accumulate reactive lipid species in these organs. Therefore the pathologies of the liver and &#x003b2;-cell observed in the POKO mouse may be a result of a common lipotoxic insult facilitated by the absence of PPARg2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030064-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in this study we provide new insights into the physiological relevance of the PPARg2 isoform and identify adipose tissue expandability as an important determinant of metabolic complications. Ablation of PPARg2 decreases adipose tissue expandability, but its pathophysiological effects only become relevant in the context of a mismatch between energy availability and adipose tissue expansion. We show that PPARg2 also plays protective role when expressed de novo in peripheral organs by increasing their capacity to buffer toxic lipids. Ablation of PPARg2 under conditions of positive energy balance determined by absence of leptin produced early development of severe insulin resistance, &#x003b2;-cell failure, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia.
