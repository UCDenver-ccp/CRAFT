These findings provide fundamental starting points for identifying the novel cellular and molecular activities of huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues that govern normal anterior streak development. This knowledge may prove to be important for understanding the mechanism by which the dominant polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin determines the loss of neurons in Huntington's disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by CAG repeats in the <italic>HD </italic>locus that extend a polyglutamine tract in a ubiquitous HEAT domain protein called huntingtin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The molecular mechanism by which the new property that is conferred on huntingtin by the polyglutamine expansion leads to the hallmark loss of striatal neurons in HD is not known. However, polyglutamine expansions in unrelated proteins that target distinct neuronal cell populations cause distinct 'polyglutamine' neurodegenerative disorders. This observation strongly suggests that the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine expansion in the context of huntingtin must be determined by some aspect of huntingtin's structure, subcellular location or activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Huntingtin is postulated to function as a flexible ~350 kDa HEAT domain scaffold that may facilitate the assembly and possibly the subcellular location of large protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Huntingtin's large number of diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear protein binding partners strongly suggest that huntingtin may participate in a variety of cellular processes that range from trafficking of growth factor complexes to gene transcription (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, despite the potential importance of huntingtin's normal function to our understanding of how the dominant polyglutamine mutation causes HD pathology, huntingtin's precise molecular and cellular activities have not been defined.</p><p>Therefore, we, and others, set out to discover huntingtin's essential activities by studying the effects of huntingtin deficiency in the mouse. Inactivation of the mouse HD gene (<italic>Hdh</italic>) has shown that huntingtin is not required for cell viability, as evidenced by the survival of mouse embryonic stem cells and neurons that lack huntingtin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, huntingtin is needed at the level of the organism for proper mammalian embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Complete lack of huntingtin results in developmental arrest during gastrulation, while severe reduction of huntingtin levels results in abnormal neurogenesis and perinatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of huntingtin deficient <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos reveals that homozygous inactivation of the mouse <italic>HD </italic>gene does not overtly affect development until E7.0. By E7.5, mutant embryos exhibit a shortened primitive streak, reduced size and, by morphology, lack a node and head folds. Mutants are rapidly resorbed by E8.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Importantly, the expression of huntingtin only in extraembryonic tissues in chimeras rescues this gastrulation phenotype, suggesting that huntingtin is required only in cells of the extraembryonic lineage and acts in a cell non-autonomous manner at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Extraembryonic tissues are essential for supplying nutrients and signals that direct anterior/posterior axis formation and patterning in the developing embryo (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), implicating huntingtin in either or both of these processes. Of these possibilities, the nutritive role has been more extensively investigated. However, huntingtin deficient embryos do not display obvious visceral endoderm defects, with the notable exception of compromised iron transport in later stage mutants, although iron uptake is undisturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and endocytosis is not impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos or embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>By the same token, huntingtin shuttles through the nucleus, where it is required for proper nuclear localization of its transcription factor partners, suggesting that huntingtin may play a role in transcription cascades in extraembryonic tissues that pattern the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we have examined this hypothesis, by monitoring the expression of genes that determine normal embryonic patterning and morphogenesis in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>huntingtin deficient embryos. Our results support and refine the hypothesis, indicating that huntingtin is required for proper mesoderm patterning and for normal regional restriction of the expression of a subset of growth and transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Huntingtin-deficient embryos exhibit abnormal streak progression and paraxial mesoderm production</title><p>Since extraembryonic tissues supply nutrients to the developing embryo, we tested the possibility that huntingtin deficiency may perturb this function by performing RT-PCR analysis to examine the expression of a panel of 'nutritive' genes in E7.5 wild-type and <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>huntingtin deficient embryos.

These results indicate appropriate specification and movement of anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) cells from the distal tip and suggest that neuroectoderm is induced in the mutant embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>AVE displacement and anterior neurectoderm induction occur normally in the absence of huntingtin</bold>.

Asymmetrical expression of <italic>Hesx </italic>in mutant embryos (F) suggests that left-right transcriptional control is maintained. <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2; </italic>expression in the definitive endoderm extends around the distal tip and is reduced in the AVE (*) in both normal (G,I) and mutant embryos (H,J).

In wild-type embryos, <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2; </italic>expression is confined to the node and anterior definitive endoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G,I</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Mutant embryos exhibit <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2;</italic>-reactive definitive endoderm over the disorganized anterior streak region and proceeding rostrally around the distal tip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H,J</xref>). In both normal and mutant embryos, the AVE exhibits little <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2; </italic>expression. Therefore, huntingtin deficiency does not greatly affect <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2; </italic>regulation or the reorganization of the visceral endoderm.</p><p>The lack of a morphological node and presence of a shortened streak, together with reduced neuroectoderm and lack of headfolds, suggest that anterior streak formation may be impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos. To investigate this possibility, we examined mesoderm formation in mutant embryos. Mesoderm is specified in the mutant embryos, as marked by the expression of <italic>T </italic>(<italic>Brachyury</italic>) and <italic>Evx1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;F</xref>). However, close inspection of the data reveals abnormal patterning within this tissue and its derivatives.<italic>T</italic>, normally expressed in the primitive streak, node and axial head process/notochord mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is detected in the shortened streak and axial mesoderm in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos, extending rostrally from a region of weakly positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). <italic>T </italic>expression appears weaker, however, in the anterior streak, corresponding to cells that will give rise to axial mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). <italic>T </italic>is also ectopically expressed in mutant extraembryonic mesoderm at the anterior embryonic junction and along the chorion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,D</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Evx1</italic>, normally expressed in primitive streak mesoderm at E7.5 with highest levels in proximal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], is expressed in the proximal shortened streak but is also aberrantly expressed throughout the extraembryonic mesoderm, allantois and chorion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref>). Extraembryonic mesoderm, derived from the proximal streak, does not normally express <italic>T </italic>or <italic>Evx1 </italic>in wild-type embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the inappropriate expression of <italic>T </italic>and <italic>Evx1</italic>, the shortened primitive streak, and the absence of a morphological node, all suggest that the anterior primitive streak is deficient in the mutant embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Huntingtin is required for formation of anterior primitive streak and paraxial mesoderm</bold>. Whole mount and section <italic>insitu </italic>hybridizations of E7.5 embryos shows <italic>T </italic>(<italic>Brachyury</italic>) (A-D) is expressed in the primitive streak, node, axial mesoderm and <italic>Evx1 </italic>(E-F) is expressed in the primitive streak, most strongly in the proximal streak wild-type embryos. However, in mutant embryos, both <italic>T </italic>(B, D) and <italic>Evx1 </italic>(F) are ectopically expressed in the extraembryonic region. <italic>Wnt3A </italic>expression is reduced in mutant embryos (H), although the localization of its expression to the proximal streak is the same as in wild-type embryos (G). Analysis of paraxial mesoderm markers <italic>Tbx6 </italic>(I,J) and <italic>Dll1 </italic>(K,L), reveals that these markers are reduced in mutant embryos (J,L), suggesting impaired paraxial mesoderm production in the absence of huntingtin.

In (C,D), al = allantois, a = amnion, ch = chorion, ee = embryonic node(N), em = extraembryonic mesoderm, n = node, ps = primitive streak. Rather than a node, mutant embryos exhibit a region of disorganized cells (*) at the distal extent of the short primitive streak.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-5-17-2"></graphic></fig><p>The anterior streak generates paraxial mesoderm. Therefore we examined paraxial mesoderm formation in wild-type and mutant embryos, revealing deficits in mesoderm patterning. Starting at E.7.5, <italic>Wnt3A </italic>is expressed in the primitive streak in cells fated to become paraxial mesoderm. In huntingtin deficient mutants, <italic>Wnt3a </italic>is induced in the proximal streak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>), confirming stage appropriate posterior development, in contrast to the absence of anterior head folds. However, expression of <italic>Wnt3a </italic>is noticeably reduced in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos, suggesting a defect in paraxial mesoderm development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). Reduced expression of <italic>Tbx6 </italic>in the mesoderm lateral to the primitive streak in mutant embryos confirms this interpretation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I,J</xref>). Furthermore, in mutant embryos at E7.5, the expression of <italic>Dll1 </italic>in the distal streak region and in only a narrow swath of cells located laterally confirms the paucity of paraxial mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K,L</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). These results strongly suggest that anterior primitive streak formation is impaired, resulting in reduced axial and paraxial mesoderm formation and impaired neural development.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired regional restriction of growth factor expression in the absence of huntingtin</title><p>To elucidate the apparent patterning deficits, we next analyzed signaling molecules that are required for early patterning. <italic>Nodal</italic>, a member of the <italic>Tgf&#x003b2; </italic>family of secreted molecules is required for the formation and maintenance of the primitive streak and induction of the AVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Nodal </italic>is normally expressed throughout the epiblast and overlying visceral endoderm at early post implantation stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but later becomes restricted to the posterior of the embryo to the site of primitive streak with asymmetrical visceral endoderm expression marking the left-right axis. By E7.5, <italic>Nodal </italic>expression is restricted to the node. <italic>Nodal </italic>expression was assessed in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos heterozygous for the <italic>Ndl lac Z </italic>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

These results suggest that, in contrast to proper <italic>Hnf3&#x003b2; </italic>regulation, <italic>Gsc </italic>remains inappropriately activated in mutant visceral and definitive endoderm, implicating huntingtin in the proper restriction of this homeodomain transcription factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Huntingtin is not required for expression of extraembryonic signaling molecules</title><p>Previous studies of chimeric embryos suggest that huntingtin is required only in the extraembryonic tissue for proper development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Bmp4 is a signaling molecule that is first expressed uniformly throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm and subsequently is localized to a ring of extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]).

Wnt and nodal antagonists, <italic>Dkk1 </italic>(<italic>mdkk-1</italic>) and <italic>Lefty1 </italic>respectively, are expressed in the AVE and are important in limiting the posteriorization of the anterior embryo by restricting Nodal and Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

In pursuing the finding that huntingtin is needed only in extraembryonic tissues for normal gastrulation, our data fail to provide evidence of abnormal nutritive gene expression in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos. Instead, our results reveal that huntingtin is required for normal anterior streak formation and the consequent production of paraxial mesoderm, with a previously unrecognized role for huntingtin in the proper extinction of transiently and/or dynamically expressed genes.</p><p>Indeed, the hallmark of the huntingtin deficient molecular phenotype is the impaired down-regulation of a subset of dynamically expressed genes, after the proper onset of expression. This phenomenon does not reflect a lack of anterior/posterior axis formation, as evidenced by the formation of the AVE anteriorly and the primitive streak posteriorly. Nor can it be simply explained by delayed development, as stage-specific markers, such as <italic>Wnt3a </italic>and primordial germ cells, which are detectable at E7.0 in wild-type embryos, are induced appropriately. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>T </italic>and <italic>Evx1 </italic>in the extraembryonic mesoderm of mutant embryos is not a feature of wild-type embryos, even at earlier stages. This strongly suggests that in huntingtin deficient embryos, the migration of the distal streak derivatives to the extraembryonic mesoderm occurs normally but that the down-regulation of these genes is impaired. This impairment may also explain the failure of huntingtin deficient embryos to properly restrict the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, <italic>Nodal </italic>and <italic>Gsc</italic>. Thus, huntingtin may play a direct role in the transcriptional regulation, or mRNA stability of these genes or it may act indirectly by intersecting with other pathways that regulate the expression of these genes.</p><p>The requirement for huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues had prompted us to test whether impaired extraembryonic signals might be responsible for the dysregulation of gene expression within the epiblast that is observed in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos. Extraembryonic development in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos is associated with mildly elevated levels expression of <italic>Hnf4 </italic>in the primitive endoderm and <italic>Pem </italic>in the lopsided anterior chorion but the expression of other known signals, such as <italic>Bmp4 </italic>from the extraembryonic ectoderm, and <italic>Dkk1 </italic>and <italic>Lefty1 </italic>from the AVE, appear to be normal, although the slight increase in <italic>Dkk-1 </italic>expression in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos suggests that further investigation into Wnt signaling is warranted. Moreover, extraembryonic Bmp4 signaling is not impaired in the absence of huntingtin, as the induction of PCGs in mutant embryos is normal, implying proper transport and secretion of the appropriate extraembryonic signals. However, <italic>Nodal</italic>, <italic>Fgf8 </italic>and <italic>Gsc </italic>are expressed ectopically in the visceral endoderm of <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos. Both Nodal and Fgf8, important growth factors required for normal development of the epiblast, are tightly regulated during gastrulation. Therefore, misexpression of either or both of these factors, or of goosecoid, in the visceral endoderm could contribute to the <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>mutant phenotype. In addition, it is possible that other extraembryonic signal(s) that we have not analyzed may also be affected by the lack of huntingtin activity in extraembryonic cells in mutant embryos.</p><p>Huntingtin deficient embryos also fail to form headfolds, and to undergo organogenesis, even after culturing in nutrient rich media. The absence of headfold formation in these embryos does not appear to be a result of a failure to induce neurectoderm or a failure to form the AVE, since mutant embryos express markers such as <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Ddk1</italic>, <italic>Lefty1 </italic>and <italic>Hesx1</italic>. In addition, since node formation is not required for neural induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], the failure to form a node in huntingtin deficient embryos is also unlikely to explain the lack of headfolds. The apparent reduction of paraxial mesoderm in <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5</sup>/<italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>embryos could explain the lack of headfolds since paraxial mesoderm is important for the full development of neuroectoderm, and consequently, headfolds. Alternatively, the inability to manifest headfolds could suggest that huntingtin is required at a very early stage for normal CNS development. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that severely reduced levels of huntingtin, from a hypomorphic <italic>Hdh </italic>allele, lead to abnormal brains later in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The cardinal features of complete <italic>Hdh </italic>inactivation that we observe are similar to the phenotypes that stem from the complete inactivation of the Polycomb group gene (Pc-g) <italic>Eed </italic>(<underline>e</underline>mbryonic <underline>e</underline>ctoderm <underline>d</underline>evelopment). Indeed, complete deficiency for either huntingtin or the eed protein leads to abnormal streak development, lack of headfold formation, ectopic <italic>T</italic>, <italic>Evx1 </italic>and <italic>Nodal </italic>expression and disruption of anterior primitive streak mesoderm production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, Eed protein is also required for proper trophoblast development and normal maintenance of imprinted X-inactivation and genomic imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting that these activities warrant investigation in huntingtin deficient embryos.</p><p>Thus, our observations provide unexpected starting-points in the search for huntingtin's precise molecular activities, which began with the discovery that this HEAT domain protein hosts the dominant polyglutamine property that is the fundamental basis of HD pathogenesis. In HD patients and in accurate genetic replicas, <italic>HD </italic>CAG knock-in mice, the dominant mutation specifically affects the major population of neurons in the striatum, without impairing huntingtin's essential activities in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Indeed, homozygous HD patients make no wild-type huntingtin, and, in the mouse, a single mutant <italic>Hdh </italic>allele's worth of mutant huntingtin can fully rescue huntingtin deficiency embryonic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The quest to understand the HD mechanism, therefore, is aimed at delineating the huntingtin activity that may explain the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine mutant version of huntingtin. One hypothesis is that huntingtin is normally involved in gene transcription, as proposed for NRSF/REST mediated BDNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Now, our finding that huntingtin can be absolutely necessary for the appropriate regulation of genes with dynamic expression patterns <italic>in vivo</italic>, provides a compelling reason to elucidate the cellular machinery that is necessary for huntingtin mediated gene regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that huntingtin is required for proper patterning of the epiblast during early embryogenesis, for proper anterior streak and node formation, primitive streak progression, paraxial mesoderm and head fold formation, as well as for the proper restriction of transiently expressed growth and transcription factor genes. Knowledge of the molecular basis of these changes in huntingtin deficient embryos should facilitate the identification of the cellular pathways that are dependent on huntingtin activities. These will be important for implicating candidates to be assessed in the extraembryonic signals that determine anterior streak progression in the developing embryo and in delineating the dominant activity of the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin that determines the striatal specificity of HD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and genotyping</title><p>The <italic>Hdh</italic><sup><italic>ex</italic>4/5 </sup>mice carrying a <italic>pGKneo </italic>insertion/replacement inactivating mutation in the mouse <italic>HD </italic>gene homologue have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
