### Creating alternative file formats
The distribution has been streamlined to include only a single file format for each annotation type. In place of multiple file formats for each annotation type, the CRAFT corpus is distributed with a script which can convert annotations from the native file format into a variety of other file formats. Please see the [Creating alternative annotation file formats](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/CRAFT/wiki/Alternative-annotation-file-formats) wiki page for details.
