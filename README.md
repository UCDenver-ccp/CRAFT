# The Colorado Richly Annotated Full-Text (CRAFT) Corpus

The contents of this repository consist of the v3.1 release of the CRAFT Corpus.  This release consists of 67 articles from the PubMed Central Open Access subset, each of which has been annotated along a number of different axes. Please see the [CRAFT Wiki](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/CRAFT/wiki) for further details on the corpus distribution. 

### Concept annotation
Concepts mentioned in these articles have been mapped (“normalized”) to specific ontology classes, relying on ten Open Biomedical Ontologies. For additional details see this [README](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/CRAFT/blob/master/concept-annotation/README.md).

### Coreference annotation
The corpus has been annotated with coreference relations, including identity and appositives, for all coreferring base noun phrases.

### Structural annotation
All sentences have been marked up with respect to sentence segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tags, grammatical dependency, and treebanking. Document section boundaries and typography (e.g., italics, boldface, subscript, superscript) have also been extracted from the source document files.

_The following article explores syntactic tool performance over CRAFT:_<br/>
